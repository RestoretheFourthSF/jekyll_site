      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 5th 2014, the Shame on Feinstein coalition delivered 2,000 signatures gathered from Californians to the Senator&#39;s staff. California is home to the Silicon Valley and to many of technological visionaries that built the Internet. Senator Feinstein has advocated for nothing less than the transformation of Internet into a tools for pervasive surveillance of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shame On Feinstein coalitions told the Senator&#39;s staff than nothing less than a ban on un-targeted, dragnet surveillance was acceptable to her constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Feinstein&#39;s term ends in 2018 and she is unlikely to run again. The Shame on Feinstein coalition will do anything in our power to ensure that the fake reforms bills she supports from FISA Improvements Act to the House version of USA Freedom Act do not become law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Roesler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started handing out badge ribbons this morning at around 7:20am. I picked a spot on the sidewalk just to the south of the keynote entrance (which began at 8am). I had handed out about 100 ribbons in 15 minutes before the building security came out and said that the sidewalk was private property and I needed to go down to the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I moved down to the corner of 4th and Howard to join Zaki. We handed out about 400 ribbons until around 8:15am, when another building security guy came up and said that they had permits for that block. I needed to go to work at that point anyway, so we packed up and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I&#39;d say that it was a big success this morning. Zaki and I were wearing suits so we were well received by the attendees walking by. There was one guy who said he worked for the RSA and that that is not what happened and I should be ashamed of myself. I asked for him to give an interview so he could explain more, but he stormed off. Another few people took a small stack of ribbons so they could hand them out inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell Colbert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had a radically different experience thankfully. I stayed up at Yerba Buena Garden and approached people on their way to or from lunch. I had no run ins with security and gave out over a hundred ribbons in about an hour and a half. I encountered a lot of push backs, many people didn&#39;t even bother to stop but some were real supporters. Only one was very pro-NSA, when I explained what RSA did for the NSA her response was something to the effect of &#39;yay for patriots, I feel safer.&#39; I&#39;ve done enough canvassing to know not to engage people like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had three notable positive interactions. One with a gentleman from Booz Allen Hamilton who wholeheartedly supported the cause but felt he would be risking his job to display a ribbon on his badge. A gentleman from Forrester Research said something very similar but took two ribbons and tweeted a photo on the spot. Another guy mentioned having already given a pro-4th Amendment speech and hoping to do more. I wanted to try to recruit people into future actions but I didn&#39;t know what actions or how to go about it. I should have at least gotten business cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had many more good conversations about the RSA&#39;s complacency with the NSA, more than I can list. I had the opposite experience with ribbons too, for me everyone wanted to Support the 4th, rather than RSA Selling Them Out. I did end up coming across two RSA employees. One asked me if I knew the whole story or if I was just told to hand out ribbons. I responded that I knew as much as any member of the public could hope as I have read a lot on the matter. He said there was more to it and I inquired as to what but he refused to answer saying that there was too much to explain. I encouraged him and the RSA to find time to explain and wished him a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dennis Gonzales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing very well near the conference building entrance, especially when Code Pink revealed their banner but was asked to move on to the corner sidewalk at 5th street.  Security officer said that was a public sidewalk but everywhere else was for RSA.  He was a nice about it so I didn’t challenge him.  But another security officer was keeping eye out on us on 5th street.  I notice the Europeans were more concern about the NSA/RSA than their US counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;the-rsa-conference-protestvolunteer-experiences/&quot; title=&quot;The RSA Conference Protest:Volunteer Experiences&quot;&gt;Volunteer Experiences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/ari/12803419154/player/d7c5dca653&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, February 25th, 2014, I biked down to Moscone Center in San Francisco to participate in a small action to protest RSA’s taking of $10 million from the NSA to weaken security in their own product. There was an RSA conference in the center at the time. I stood on the sidewalk, and handed out badge ribbons to attendees. “Did you know RSA took $10 million from the NSA? We’ve got stickers for your badges.” A few people were dismissive, many ignored us or said no, but quite a few took the stickers (we handed out almost 2000 in one day). Some people asked for more to give out at sessions they were going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had two types of ribbons. One said “RSA sold us out” and the other said “I support the 4th” (as in Amendment to the Constitution). I would have thought that the first, being a more aggressive message, would be less popular, but no, actually it was more popular! Perhaps this is because of the large number of foreigners at the conference - Europeans seem particularly riled up about NSA spying - with whom talk of the US Constitution doesn’t resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was warned by others that the conference staff wouldn’t “let” us hand them out on the sidewalk right outside Moscone center. I decided I would do it anyway, and for a long time was not harassed by any conference staff. I moved around a bit, though, around the different corners of 4th St and Howard, trying to find which one had the best flow of foot traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, when I was standing on the corner right outside Moscone Center (the west corner of the intersection of 4th and Howard), a staff member did tell me to stop, and I said I wouldn’t. He said he would get the cop from inside, and I told him to go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officer Shavers SFPD 38 being a right sick. Saying I can&amp;#39;t stand on the corner of Howard and 4th outside Moscone and hand out stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Martin MacKerel (@kemokid) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kemokid/statuses/438420099733520384&quot;&gt;February 25, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon a cop who reminded me strongly of the character of “Doakes” from the show “Dexter” appeared. He was immediately incredibly belligerent, getting right in my personal space and refusing to answer my questions. When I said that the sidewalk was public, not private, property, he said that it was city property and that the conference had a permit for the sidewalk as well as the conference center itself. When I objected that there was no bronze placard in the sidewalk or other overt indication that it was not public property, he just told me to move across the street. When I asked, he identified himself as Officer Shavers, badge number 38 (SFPD). I asked to see the permit, and he refused. He said he would arrest me if staff asked for a CA (a citizen’s arrest), and then immediately turned to the staff member standing a few feet away and asked him if he wanted to make a citizen’s arrest. I was pissed off that he wouldn’t engage me in conversation about this, and asked if he would walk with me across the street to talk about the situation. He wouldn&#39;t, and told me again to cross the street to the south corner. At that point I said I would cross when the light changed, and I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Won&amp;#39;t show me a permit either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Martin MacKerel (@kemokid) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kemokid/statuses/438420154951561216&quot;&gt;February 25, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being a neutral arbiter of the law and of the permitting situation, he was clearly siding with the staff and trying to get me to leave without listening to me. I should emphasize that I was engaged in the mildest of First Amendment activity - talking to one or a handful of people at a time and passing out material. I didn’t have a bullhorn, nor was I engaging people for more than a few seconds if they were not interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I crossed over to the east corner of the intersection - kitty-corner from where the officer had confronted me. To my surprise, he came up to me and resumed his belligerent and threatening behaviour. When I expressed incredulity that even that corner was covered by the permit, he told me that if I wanted to be on that block that I had to cross to the east side of 3rd St (a full block away). The only option nearby, it seemed, was the south corner of 4th and Howard by the Oasis Grill. I asked again to see the permit. He told me that he knew the permit was valid and good, and I didn’t need to see it. He brought his handcuffs out from his belt and flashed them menacingly at me. I retreated to the south corner, but first I asked to talk with his supervisor. He said his commanding officer was Sergeant Miller, and that he would come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, he crossed to the south corner and said “you asked me to speak with you?” and I said, “well, yes, I did when we first talked, on the west corner”. I said I wanted to wait to speak with the sergeant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About ten minutes later, a couple more cops showed up on the west corner. They were soon all in discussion with conference staff, and were poring over some papers - presumably the permit. I waited about 15 minutes for the sergeant to come over and talk to me, but he never did. Eventually, I walked over and DM came with me to record the interaction. Sergeant Miller had a very reasonable tone of voice, and said that the staff had been confused, and that we were allowed to be on the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t apologize, but I was okay with the outcome. I decided not to make a fuss about Officer Shavers’s behaviour, and walked across to the north corner to resume handing out badge ribbons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Miller showed up. Said the conference staff were confused. Said we had the right to be on the sidewalk. Thought so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Martin MacKerel (@kemokid) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kemokid/statuses/438433432033427456&quot;&gt;February 25, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to leave it at that - it seemed like an honest (if aggressive and bull-headed) mistake on the part of the original officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later I found out that during a separate action earlier in the day, both Shavers and Sergeant Miller had been on the scene when another “confusion” about the permit occurred. You can see Miller (gray-haired buzz cut) and conference staff looking over the permit here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/ari/12803154953/player/cb953040e9&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This to me raises this incident from a one-off mistake to an abuse of power. The staff had already conveniently over-interpreted their permit, and the police had already looked over the permit. Shavers abused his power as a police officer to bully me off the corner with credible threats of arrest, despite the fact that I had every right to be on the sidewalk, which is public property. Moreover, the conference staff used this on-duty police officer to push away free speech that they didn’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I will pursue some kind of recourse or official complaint against the behaviour of the SFPD in this case. But I am considering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my opinion of RSA has actually been lowered. No mean feat. I don’t expect them to embrace criticism, but to use the police to squelch basic First Amendment rights - that’s beyond the pale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, Feb 25 2013-Today, RSA opened their annual security security and Restore the Fourth SF was there to protest.  RSA&#39;s history of bad actions are beyond the pale and could not go unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;rsa-sold-us-out-why-we-protest/&quot; title=&quot;RSA Sold Us Out! Why We Protest…&quot;&gt;Why We Protest...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;the-rsa-conference-protestvolunteer-experiences/&quot; title=&quot;The RSA Conference Protest:Volunteer Experiences&quot;&gt;Volunteer Experiences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/ari/12802969193/player/13ed312945&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2004, RSA selected an elliptic curve random number generator called DUAL_EC_DRBG as the default in their products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2007, two Microsoft Researchers discovered that DUAL_EC_DRBG has predictable output known only to the designer of the algorithm. This would world permit the NSA to discover secret cryptographic keys generated by this random number generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September 2013, the revelations about mass NSA surveillance made the situation with DUAL_EC_DRBG untenable and RSA changed their guidance to customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In December 2013, Reuters obtained the original contract between RSA and the NSA that specified the selection of DUAL_EC_DRBG and a payment of $10 million dollars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;These questions are a matter of public record. The fundamental question ignorant of the state of the art in cryptography research and thus grossly negligent or were the co conspirators with the NSA?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was RSA aware of patent US2007189527 that discloses the backdoor in DUAL_EC_DRBG?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was RSA aware of publication of the backdoor by Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson from Microsoft?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The most profound consequence of RSA complicity is that there is circumstantial evidence that this is not an isolated incident. DUAL_EC_DRBG is a part of an NSA program called BULLRUN with an annual budget of $250 million.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Restore the Fourth SF took the annual RSA conference as opportunity to prompt discussion among the attendees of government backdoors and their impact on trustworthiness of the American technology. We handed out badge ribbons with the message &quot;I Support the 4th&quot; or &quot;RSA Sold Us Out&quot;. The latter was far more popular. Restore the Fourth SF volunteers took up positions on the sidewalks to hand out the ribbons. We had some negative encounters with RSA security staff but eventually SFPD accepted that we have free speech rights on public side walks. We distributed approx 1500 badge ribbons to attendees. We were able to educate many people who where unaware of NSA bad practices.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Restore the Fourth SF applauds  RSA Security executive chairman Art Coviello call &lt;a href=&quot;https://threatpost.com/rsas-coviello-calls-for-global-surveillance-reforms-enhanced-privacy-protection/104468&quot;&gt;to breakup the NSA, ban cyber weapons and end mass surveillance&lt;/a&gt;. We will be watching RSA&#39;s future actions to see they begin to make amends for the damage caused to their customers and the technology industry as a whole.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shining A Light on the NSA: Outdoor Projection at Room 641A, NSA Interception Site at 611 Folsom Street&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-On Tuesday February 11th at 6:00pm, Bay Area residents will join people all over the world outraged by revelations about National Security Agency and private corporations blanket electronic surveillance in &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedaywefightback.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Day We Fight Back&lt;/a&gt;, a national online protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco event will be at AT&amp;amp;T, 611 Folsom Street in San Francisco. The AT&amp;amp;T building houses an NSA interception room in Room 641A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The convergence will feature giant projected visuals by the SF Projection Department, Bay Area Light Brigade human billboard signs, and a Stop Watching Us parachute. Speakers include Mark, Klein, a former AT&amp;amp;T technician who blew the whistle on the NSA facility in AT&amp;amp;T in 2006, and representatives from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, The Bill of Rights Defense Committee and Restore The Fourth - Bay Area. Music provided by Michael Rufo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2012 , proposed SOPA and PIPA censorship legislation was met with the largest Internet protest in history. A year ago this month one of that movement&#39;s leaders, Aaron Swartz, tragically passed away. Today we face a different threat, one that undermines the Internet, and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society: mass surveillance. If Aaron were alive, he&#39;d be on the front lines, fighting against a world in which governments observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action. Now, on the anniversary of Aaron&#39;s passing, and in celebration of the win against SOPA and PIPA that he helped make possible, there is a new day of protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 15, on the Bill of Rights Day, there was a press conference announcing the Shame on Feinstein Coalition which wrote a letter to Senator Feinstein expressing their anger about her approach to the NSA issue at National Lawyers Guild San Francisco Bay Area Chapter, San Francisco, California. &lt;a title=&quot;Shame On Feinstein&quot; href=&quot;http://shameonfeinstein.org&quot;&gt;Sign the Letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple Inc. Spy Lockout  Shareholder Proposal</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/featured/2013/12/07/apple-inc-spy-lockout-shareholder-proposal/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/featured/2013/12/07/apple-inc-spy-lockout-shareholder-proposal</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Resolved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of concerned Apple shareholders proposes several technical and policy actions Apple should take immediately, without waiting to be compelled by shareholders, to quickly earn back user trust and demonstrate Apple’s competence in repelling modern threats to user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ask that the board enact a policy to use technical methods and other best practices to protect user data. Such best practices include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption: Implement encryption techniques such as Forward Secrecy and the other recommended best practices cited in the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#39;s recent reports on encryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL Key Revocation: Revoke and update SSL encryption keys and any similar digital  entities that may have been compromised, immediately and as often as necessary for the security of user data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure Network Equipment: Remove or replace any equipment that may be used for unconstitutional bulk surveillance at sites managed by Apple, to every legally permissible extent. Third-party equipment, such as interception devices installed in compliance with &quot;pen trap and trace&quot; orders, should provide access to confirm the devices can not be used for unconstitutional bulk collection or over-collection of data. If any court order or warrant must be withdrawn or revised to achieve this, Apple may seek relief from the courts – such as FISC courts that have already discovered systematic over-collection of data and ruled some programs unconstitutional – in the course of legally removing such equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency: Expand deployment of measures such as the “warrant canary” and “dead man switch” so users can be confident that Apple networks and encryption keys have not been compromised – or can be alerted if they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as a U.S. company Apple has constitutional and ethical duties that include respecting the 4th Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple should, to the full extent permissible by law, deploy its strengths in both technology and law to publicly reveal, challenge, reduce, and overturn every government attempt at covert surveillance against its customers that doesn&#39;t meet these standards: surveillance of single, identified individuals under a warrant issued by a neutral judge, particularly describing the person and places to be searched, and of limited duration. To the full extent permissible by law, Apple should not actively or passively agree to do or allow covert mass surveillance against its customers, nor remain silent about what Apple and the government have done or are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost trust will not be regained until Apple users and shareholders understand whether Apple is a paid participant in unconstitutional bulk surveillance, a hapless victim of it, a gagged hostage of government spies, badly in need of help – or, whether Apple is truly an effective foe of such surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For stewards of user data like Apple, both ethical standards and user trust are essential to sustaining shareholder value. Failing to acknowledge and address these realities can cause the company serious ongoing financial harm, particularly in international markets. Conversely, by addressing these issues forthrightly Apple can win back the trust of customers, provide leadership, offer competitive advantages, and strengthen the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shareholder Activism Instruction Manual</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/11/14/shareholder-activism-instruction-manual/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/11/14/shareholder-activism-instruction-manual</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public companies are required &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.uc.edu/sites/default/files/CCL/34ActRls/rule14a-8.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;by law&lt;/a&gt; to permit shareholders (above a threshold amount) to add items to the annual meeting&#39;s agenda. This is largely a joke now, because shares are spread so widely that too small a number could ever attend a meeting to enact the proposal. However: due to the laws governing public companies they have to publish, read aloud, and make a show of voting on the proposal anyway. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;re trying to find shareholders who own $2000 in stock of the tech companies involved in the NSA&quot;s PRISM program. Bear in mind, this probably only works for those that are traded publicly (Twitter, we&#39;re coming for you!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have a shareholder, you will want to look up the schedule for annual meetings on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Edgar&lt;/a&gt;, the SEC&#39;s search engine for documents. The stock ticker is the easiest tool to look that up. Example shareholder proposals will be listed in the proxy statements filed for each annual meeting, as well. Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312512515422/d450591dpre14a.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple Inc.&#39;s 2013 proxy statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have the date that the last annual meeting was announced, add a year and count back 120 days to approximate the deadline for filing a shareholder proposal. The rules for where to send the proposal should be listed in the proxy statement as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft a letter from the shareholder and attach the proposal (500 words maximum). The shareholder or his designee must attend the annual meeting himself in order to get a vote on the proposal. So the letter may have to designate someone to attend the annual meeting in lieu of the shareholder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let us know by editing &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApWG2DmCnC7EdFBldC1IaF9oUV9zVUNnRmJlbUk0elE#gid=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; if you take these steps, so that we do not have more than one person putting forth a proposal for that annual meeting. And see &lt;a href=&quot;http://restorethefourthsf.com/new-shareholder-activism-project-first-target-named-apple-inc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for an example of what a shareholder proposal might look like, drafted by David and Alice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=&quot;http://restorethefourthsf.com/events/aaron-swartz-memorial-hackathon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hackathon &lt;/a&gt;participants! We&#39;re the only dedicated privacy rights group in the Bay Area so we&#39;re bringing together organizations and projects on this issue. We&#39;re also drafting city council resolutions, shareholder proposals, status reports for the lawsuits, and bringing engineers and laypeople together to learn encryption techniques. Here&#39;s a summary of current projects you can help out with:&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://restorethefourthsf.com/san-francisco-board-of-supervisors-resolution-by-restore-the-fourth-sf-bay-area-and-coalition-members/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Board of Supervisors resolution&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco, which has been drafted and has amassed a lot of significant supporters. We are going to begin looking for a primary sponsor soon, and we are considering who to approach and how to approach them at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- City council resolution in Concord - Kenji is working on this and we can put you in touch with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Presentation at Apple&#39;s annual shareholder meeting in February: this is in early stages but David is working hard on this. &lt;a href=&quot;http://restorethefourthsf.com/new-shareholder-activism-project-first-target-named-apple-inc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a draft of the shareholder proposal &lt;/a&gt;we&#39;re using as a model for the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://restorethefourthsf.com/portfolio/prism-8-shareholder-activism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon and Google shareholder proposals&lt;/a&gt;: We are hoping to submit shareholder proposals for Apple and Google&#39;s annual meetings next summer. We are looking for shareholders who own more than $2,000 in shares to attend the meeting to put forth the proposal. We&#39;ll do all the heavy lifting for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The letter writing campaign project,&lt;a href=&quot;http://restorethefourthsf.com/ironing-board-democracy-letter-writing-campaign/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Cryptoparties are going to be organized by Eric and John. There&#39;s a mailing list, use the link &quot;join us&quot; at the top of the page to join it. We want to use non-tech venues and reach out to non-tech people, because we have found that there are a lot of different types of people who are interested in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Unitarians of Los Angeles v. NSA Case Management Hearing</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/11/08/unitarian-universalists-of-los-angeles-v-nsa-case-management-hearing/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/11/08/unitarian-universalists-of-los-angeles-v-nsa-case-management-hearing</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: There was nothing for the judge to rule on, and the next hearing is April 25th 2014 at 9 am (this is a hearing that hasn&#39;t been set for Jewel yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government attempted to delay the hearing twice, once on account of the government shutdown, and again because they wanted motions to be considered. The judge denied both requests and today a schedule for briefing and for the next hearing was set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, there had been some discussion of combining this case with Jewel for more efficient litigation. However, apparently both the government and the plaintiffs agreed this didn&#39;t make sense. A lawyer for of the plaintiffs laid out several differences between the cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This case is only about mass collection of phone records (note, the government refers to this as &quot;telephony metadata&quot; instead - tactical word choice?). Jewel includes internet surveillance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone record collection is being challenged while it&#39;s in progress. The Jewel case relates to several prior collection policies that may not be continuing, therefore they require inspection of the NSAs legal authority at different points in the past 12 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first amendment freedom of association issue is a crucial difference. Here, all plaintiffs are groups. In Jewel, the plaintiffs are all individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The federal government has admitted to colllecting phone records, so there is no issue of state secrets. This will help the case move faster than Jewel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We felt that the formatting of the bill in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leahy.senate.gov/download/usa-freedom-act_-introduced-10-29-131&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this pdf&lt;/a&gt; was hard to read, so we recreated it here for you with better formatting. We know that the line by line edits of existing legislation makes this a frustrating read, but the key changes are easy to see by skimming to the more substantial edits. Note: press &quot;ctrl&quot; and &quot;f&quot; at the same time to bring up the search box and begin to locate keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/10/18/new-shareholder-activism-project-first-target-named-apple-inc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We wrote a sample shareholder proposal based on our concerns with Apple. Please see the project page for more general information about how this will work. This draft was written by David with some contributions by Alice. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shareholder Proposal entitled “Consumer Privacy Commitment”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resolved &lt;/b&gt;Amendment to Article VI of the bylaws of Apple, Inc.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.2 To protect and strengthen the company’s international growth and financial future, Apple will use all possible legal avenues to disclose agreements with governments, including unclassified and classified court orders, National Security Letters, dialogues and similar – so customers are confident that all steps are taken to provide transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin this process, a committee shall be formed of the Board of Directors entitled “Customer Privacy Committee” lasting three years from the date of this shareholder meeting. All past and current letters, court orders and other exchanges with governments will be collected and re-evaluated by legal counsel to see if they may be publically disclosed. The results of this re-evaluation shall be reported to the Committee by June 30 2014 and two years following on that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting Statement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#39;s many consumer and business products and services depend on privacy and security -- that customers and users trust their data and metadata are being protected throughout Apple&#39;s systems. Such trust is central to the company&#39;s brand, systems and ongoing financial value All US and foreign persons, businesses and governments expect, value and demand control over their privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as a US corporation with US executives, Apple and its agents can be secretly compelled by legal instruments such as National Security Letters, under threat of imprisonment and other penalties, to violate this trust, its agreements with users, or allow users to be violated without fully informing them. Without transparency from Apple, millions have learned that Apple&#39;s systems&#39; data and metadata are not secure, amid bulk surveillance programs from NSA and GCHQ in programs such as PRISM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diminished trust inevitably slows the adoption of core Apple data services like iCloud and product features like Touch ID, for example. Specifically, users have no way to know which vows about Touch ID data made by Apple today may be reversed in the enforcement of a secret court order or National Security Letter tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failing to acknowledge and address these realities can cause the company serious ongoing financial harm, particularly in international markets. By addressing these issues forthrightly Apple can win back the trust of customers, provide leadership, offer competitive advantages, and strengthen the entire industry -- as Apple has done before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ro was appointed Deputy Assistance Secretary of Commerce by President Barack Obama. He is now running for Congress against Mike Honda. Ro was campaigning at the Diwali Indian Festival in Memorial Park, Cupertino California where I met him and discussed the Fourth Amendment violations happening under Congress&#39; watch. I asked Ro what he thought about the NSA program of surveillance of U.S. Citizens, and this was his response:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rick Perry is more committed to 4th Amendment Rights than Jerry Brown</title>

      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/10/12/rick-perry-is-more-committed-to-4th-amendment-rights-than-jerry-brown</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignleft&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;img-frame &quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;assets/Edmund_G_Brown_Jr.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt; Governor Jerry Brown[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today (October 12th, 2013) Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a bill that was designed to protect California residents&#39; privacy and freedom of thought. &lt;a href=&quot;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB467&quot;&gt;SB 467&lt;/a&gt; requires a warrant for state and local law enforcement to demand access to the electronic communications of any person. This would include your Gmail account or Facebook message history. Here is some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/sb-467-californias-email-privacy-bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;further background provided by the EFF&lt;/a&gt;. Under current law, no warrant is required for messages older than 30 days under what is known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/deep-dive-updating-electronic-communications-privacy-act&quot;&gt;&quot;third party doctrine&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SB 467 was put forward by Senator Mark Leno and is the second electronic privacy bill vetoed by Governor Brown. The first was SB 1434 in 2012 which would have required a warrant before a phone, computer or tablet could be searched. Thanks to the revelations uncovered by Edward Snowden, we now know that federal government surveils the electronic communications of all Americans and shares that information with state and local law enforcement at their discretion. SB 467 would prevent Calfornia&#39;s law enforcement from using information obtained unconstitutionally either at their request or provided at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Brown&#39;s&lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.ca.gov/docs/SB_467_2013_Veto_Message.pdf&quot;&gt; veto statement &lt;/a&gt;is factually inaccurate and indicates poor judgement on this issue.. We have ample evidence that the federal government is obtaining email without a warrant. It was the subject of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2010/04/13&quot;&gt;Yahoo lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; trying to stop this activity.  Not to mention unknowndragnet surveillance of electronic communications approved by the FISA court (or not, maybe). The 3 day notice that Governor Brown objects to is essentially the same as Texas&#39;s vanguard &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dont-mess-texas-email-state-law-ends-some-warrantless-email-6C10370211&quot;&gt;email privacy law&lt;/a&gt;. Governor Perry signed this law in June 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;img-frame &quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;assets/Rick_Perry_by_Gage_Skidmore_8.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt; Governor Rick Perry[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the legislature has ample grounds to override Governor Brown&#39;s veto. That should be the next step, and we hope you will contact your state senators and assemblymen on Monday to ask for a legislative override. He&#39;s given us a gift by providing us with an additional day to prepare this avalanche.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brief Overview of Federal Laws Regarding Search and Seizure of Electronic Communications</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/10/12/brief-overview-of-federal-laws-regarding-search-and-seizure-of-electronic-communications/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/10/12/brief-overview-of-federal-laws-regarding-search-and-seizure-of-electronic-communications</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generally, the search and seizure of physical property or a home without a warrant is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2236&quot;&gt;punishable as a federal crime&lt;/a&gt;. The punishment is a year in jail, even for someone acting on behalf of the government. This is the last stronghold of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding communications, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119&quot;&gt;a separate provision&lt;/a&gt;. Within that, there is a provision &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511&quot;&gt;requiring warrants for the interception of electronic communications&lt;/a&gt; which carries a sentence of five years, or alternately a paltry $500 civil fine. However, that provision is eviscerated by a big &quot;notwithstanding&quot; provision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title or section 705 or 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, it shall not be unlawful for an officer, employee, or agent of the United States in the normal course of his official duty to conduct electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as authorized by that Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a later provision allows them to have foreign governments do their dirty work for them, for example Britain intercepting underseas cables without restriction by fourth amendment rights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing contained in this chapter or chapter 121 or 206 of this title, or section 705 of the Communications Act of 1934, shall be deemed to affect the acquisition by the United States Government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications, or foreign intelligence activities conducted in accordance with otherwise applicable Federal law involving a foreign electronic communications system, utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no provision barring government storage of information (once lawfully intercepted of course). FISA is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-36&quot;&gt;Title 50, Chapter 36 &lt;/a&gt;of the code. As we know, FISA permits rubber stamped general warrants. However, the application of FISA is limited to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;specific circumstances&lt;/a&gt;, most notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(e) “Foreign intelligence information” means—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) information that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to, the ability of the United States to protect against—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A) actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(B) sabotage, international terrorism, or the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(C) clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by an agent of a foreign power; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) information with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A) the national defense or the security of the United States; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(B) the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data is collected via dragnet/bulk interception, most of the data still falls outside FISA. Therefore, the criminal sanctions that should be placed on the NSA and its co-conspirators  are lengthy. In addition, FISA only permits storage for up to one year if collected without even a FISA warrant. Violations lead to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1809&quot;&gt;five years in jail or a fine of $10,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lo! How the provisions for spying on other spies became used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>John McAfee, D Central and the Future of the Decentralized Internet</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/10/01/john-mcafee-d-central-and-the-future-of-darknets/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/10/01/john-mcafee-d-central-and-the-future-of-darknets</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, John McAfee announced a forthcoming hardware product called &lt;a title=&quot;D-Central&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4786008/john-mcafee-d-central-device-avoid-nsa-private-network&quot;&gt;D-Central &lt;/a&gt;to provide consumers with private networking services that would be resistant to NSA scrutiny. He has described his product in only the highest level terms but we can infer a lot from his description and the fundamental architecture of the Internet.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-frame alignright&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;assets/PirateBox_2-0_Case4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The D-Central seems to incorporate ideas similar to that of the &lt;a title=&quot;MeshBox&quot; href=&quot;https://fund.meshwith.me/&quot;&gt;MeshBox&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a title=&quot;PirateBox&quot; href=&quot;http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox_DIY&quot;&gt;PirateBox&lt;/a&gt;.  What all these initiatives have in common is they create a public environment where users can communicate privately without disclosing either content &lt;em&gt;or metadata&lt;/em&gt; to the Internet providers. Most other encryption methods only prevent disclosure of  content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that D-Central, Meshbox and others can offer an accessible consumer product that can provide a mass surveillance resistant Internet experience to the masses. This is clearly possible: VPN providers, botnets, et cetera all operate darknets that have been highly resistant to compromise and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this kind of privacy-friendly Internet to truly succeed, it needs to provide both a developer platform and a business model. The centralized NSA friendly Internet developed because of the seductive appeal of easy applications development in data centers and the success of the advertising model. Without a developer platform, these experiments in Darknets are only going to be able to deliver a Web 1.0 experience of messaging and file sharing rather than compelling applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are potentially compelling aspects to an NSA-proof internet for developers. They would have to raise less capital for bandwidth and servers because costs would be distributed among their users. That&#39;s a business model, but is it enough to drive development?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, these news items will convince you the answer is yes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rallies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;October 26th March on DC by Stop Watching Us Coalition&lt;/span&gt; this is coming up soon, you can RSVP on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://rally.stopwatching.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website &lt;/a&gt;or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/641805049185394/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook &lt;/a&gt;. Please email us at restorefoursf@gmail.com if you want help paying for a ticket, or if you want to financially support someone to attend the event, with  subject line “10/26 Actual Presence.” We’re hoping to organize something locally for those who cannot attend, we’ll let you know as soon as that’s decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legislation (California)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;SB 467&lt;/span&gt; State Senator Mark Leno has put forward this bill which addresses email privacy. It restores the fourth amendment by requiring warrants to read emails. &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB467 &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here is the text of the bill&lt;/a&gt;. It has been passed in the State Senate and Assembly and is sitting on Governor Brown’s desk to be signed, vetoed, or passively passed  into law. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cold.ca.gov/agency_display.asp?ATRID=GVSOFC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here is a list of phone numbers to reach him and ask him to sign the bill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Right of Privacy Resolutions&lt;/span&gt; are being prepared in San Francisco, Concord, and Palo Alto. &lt;a href=&quot;http://restorethefourthsf.com/san-francisco-board-of-supervisors-resolution-by-restore-the-fourth-sf-bay-area-and-coalition-members/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; San Francisco’s is providing the model&lt;/a&gt;. We’re going to need you to call your supervisors/councilmembers and ask them to vote in favor of the resolutions once we have primary sponsors. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legislation (Federal)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;NSA Reform Bill&lt;/span&gt; (Wyden/Udall/Paul/Blumenthal) was announced next week but has not been introduced. Wyden summarizes it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/intelligence-oversight-and-surveillance-reform-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a pdf on his website&lt;/a&gt;. When it’s been introduced in the senate, we will let you know, and you can start contacting your Senators to ask them to vote in favor of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Feinstein’s “Reform” Bill&lt;/span&gt; as you know, Feinstein made quite a fool of herself in last week’s open hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. &lt;a href=&quot;http://restorethefourthsf.com/on-the-fisa-senate-intelligence-committee-hearing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read a brief summary here&lt;/a&gt;. She’s now followed that up with a specious “reform” bill. Again, it is announced but not introduced, but we will let you know when you should start contacting your Senators to ask them to vote against the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Litigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Jewel v. NSA&lt;/span&gt; A hearing last Friday outlined the laborious process of bringing recent FOIA and Snowden releases into evidence for this old case. Read more here http://restorethefourthsf.com/jewel-v-nsa-case-management-hearing/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. NSA&lt;/span&gt; there’s a lot of overlap, some of the same lawyers and a lot of the same issues. So, on November 8th there will be a case management hearing which will decide to what extent this case should be combined with the Jewel case. Alice will attend and post a layman’s summary on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the FISA Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/30/on-the-fisa-senate-intelligence-committee-hearing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/30/on-the-fisa-senate-intelligence-committee-hearing</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thursday&#39;s Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/FISALe&quot;&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2013_hr/&quot;&gt;transcripts here&lt;/a&gt;) on the National Security Agency&#39;s surveillance programs and their (lack of) oversight and accountability was pretty vacuous.  Seeing as how the committee virtually ensured nothing was at stake during the hearing, it was dreadfully boring.  Having slogged through the entire video recording, I almost want to write committee chair (and one of my senators) Dianne Feinstein and request three hours of my life back.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the &lt;del&gt;automatons&lt;/del&gt; participants seemed to rotate between three modes of operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;Bashing Edward Snowden and &quot;the media&quot; for exposure of the National Security Agency&#39;s activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasizing the legal and transparent nature of everything the NSA, FISC, etc. do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praising the dedication, patriotism, intelligence, etc. of the United States&#39; national security employees and the members of the committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a page from the Condoleezza Rice book of fearmongering, the committee members stoked fear about the constant terrorist threats that the United States is purportedly facing.  DiFi opened up the hearing with a completely irrelevant news update about the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westgate_shopping_mall_shooting&quot;&gt;al-Shabaab attack in Kenya&lt;/a&gt;.  Several other members, notably NSA Director Keith Alexander, repeatedly implied that disrupting the NSA&#39;s programs would result (or would have resulted) in terrorist attacks upon American soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators Mark Udall and Ron Wyden, the two on the intelligence committee who have been mildly critical of the NSA, were the lone exceptions to the hours-long monotony.  They at least asked some questions that could not be characterized as softballs, but were really unable to pursue a line of questioning given the five-minute limit that DiFi placed on each senator&#39;s question and answer session with the panelists (Alexander, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Deputy Attorney General James Cole).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing finished up with statements from two NSA supporters, Ben Wittes and Tim Edgar.  Their sycophantic performances ensured the hearing could conclude without any interesting information filtering through to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several senators in their non-questions to Alexander and Clapper seemed to have a less than adequate grasp of the hearing&#39;s subject matter.  Marcy Wheeler comments that these senators &quot;filibustered themselves so they wouldn’t have to ask any questions (and therefore betray ignorance).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiFi again should win the award for most supercilious defense of a secretive government national security program.  Opening the hearing with the statement that &quot;The public has a misperception and that must be corrected,&quot; she gaslighted throughout the hearing, uttering such ridiculous assertions as &quot;Much of the press has called this a surveillance program.  It is not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very hard to escape the conclusion that Glenn Greenwald came to after watching the hearing: &quot;The very idea that meaningful reform of the NSA will come out of this annexed, captured, corrupted Committee is ludicrous on its face.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverage on the hearing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Jewel v. NSA Case Management Hearing</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/featured/2013/09/28/jewel-v-nsa-case-management-hearing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/featured/2013/09/28/jewel-v-nsa-case-management-hearing</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Jewel v. NSA&lt;/span&gt; is one of several cases against unconstitutional surveillance in the courts. This one is FIVE years old - in fact, it was originally founded on the facts revealed by Mark Klein, who spoke at our rally on 1984 Day. For background and further documents, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Electronic Frontier Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;. Today, we heard a very interesting ruling from the judge in the case, that fundamentally benefits the plaintiffs (all US citizens and all AT&amp;amp;T customers, each represented by a lead plaintiff). But, it&#39;s procedurally and strategically complex, so it bears some explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: A whole lot of evidence that was declassified or otherwise made public can now be used to establish standing in the case.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does that matter?&lt;/strong&gt; The courts require evidence that the plaintiff has been a victim of illegal surveillance for the case to move forward - this is &quot;standing&quot;. The government has cunningly classified the targets of surveillance so that the victims cannot present their evidence to the court. The Snowden releases and FOIA releases have lead to a massive declassification of evidence necessary to show that every American has the right to sue. To cite the releases for the purposes of arguing standing, they must be in the record. The case, however, is premised on old filings and the admissibility of classified evidence has already been addressed - so, we have to ask the judge to include the new information in the record. Fortunately the judge reopened that can of worms, and ordered the government to revise the classified/withheld evidence and add evidence  that was declassified to the record, giving the plaintiffs the ability to base their arguments on the releases. &lt;em&gt;The judge wants to see facts distinguishing this case from &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clapper v. Amnesty International&lt;/span&gt;, and has handed access to those facts to the plaintiffs on a platter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will describe the hearing in detail, and correct me if you think that was not what he did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge issued a ruling today based on many briefs filed on &quot;threshold&quot; issues. Threshold issues are things like standing, preemption, access to classified evidence, etc - before the government explains why it is not in violation of the Fourth Amendment. So far the government has not written their answer to the complaint - they have merely raised the threshold issues. &lt;em&gt;We were hoping that today, the judge would dispose of the threshold issues and set a schedule for discovery&lt;/em&gt;. That didn&#39;t happen, but as I said earlier, it&#39;s for the best. If the judge had ruled that the plaintiffs had standing, that would have been appealed (technical term: &quot;interlocutory appeal&quot;), further delaying the case. And the plaintiffs still wouldn&#39;t have anything stronger than &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clapper v. Amnesty International&lt;/span&gt;, who didn&#39;t have standing according to the Supreme Court. So back to square one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge laid out four more threshold issues, with arguments to be submitted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. If FISA overrides the state secrets doctrine for the statutory claims under FISA (an act of congress), does it also override it for constitutional claims? To be submitted by the government by &lt;strong&gt;Dec 20&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly complicated issue, but suffice to say, the state secret doctrine does NOT benefit us. It allows the government to hide more evidence. So far, the judge has only ruled that FISA overrides it for statutory claims. But we care about the constitutional claims (violations of the Fourth Amendment) far more. The government does not want FISA to override the state secrets doctrine, so that&#39;s what they will be arguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Do the FISA procedural mechanisms also apply for the constitutional claims? To be submitted by the government by &lt;strong&gt;Dec 20&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno what this is about, or what affect it has. Seems unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. If FISA overrides both statutory claims and constitutional claims, and the FISA procedural mechanisms apply to both: &lt;em&gt;Show that the plaintiffs have standing without damage to national security, with reference to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clapper v. Amnesty International&lt;/span&gt; footnote 4.&lt;/em&gt; To be submitted by the plaintiffs by &lt;strong&gt;Jan 31&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; so to speak. See above - we need to show that the harm is not speculative or future-oriented, but that it has already occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. After the record has been corrected to reflect declassified documents, the government must show the actual impact of the purported risks to national security. To be briefed by the government by &lt;strong&gt;Dec 20&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two additional crucial points made by the judge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government must revise/put into evidence the declassified documents by&lt;strong&gt; Dec 20&lt;/strong&gt; - that means they have to comb through all evidence ever withheld from 2007, 2009 and 2012. And the judge anticipates in advance that the plaintiffs will insist more documents were declassified and that the government missed stuff, and plans that they can raise those objections on &lt;strong&gt;Jan 10&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The judge anticipates that there may be further FOIA releases and therefore the plaintiffs may ask for a further delay to add the evidence if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the deck is stacked in favor of the plaintiffs here. They have one issue to argue, and they already know what&#39;s declassified/citable, so they have a lot more time to write it. However, each party has to write a response, and then a further reply, to each issue. The final filings are due &lt;strong&gt;Feb 28&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, we can expect a ruling by spring 2014. That means the government&#39;s answer, and discovery, and all the other juicy stuff won&#39;t come until next summer. But at least the argument for standing is extremely strong now. We must get past threshhold issues to get anywhere in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And at the end of the day&lt;/strong&gt; Fourth Amendment protections of electronic data, metadata, and a host of other private things haven&#39;t been awarded by the Supreme Court. Our greatest hope is in a Supreme Court ruling  that embraces the full reality of the NSA&#39;s activities, and the full reality of electronic data as it stands today. These court cases are essential. They are slow, frustrating, and may appear irrelevant. But one perspective is that it&#39;s the crowded on-ramp to the superhighway of freedom.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you all tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the draft being submitted to the BORDC, the EFF, and potential primary sponsors. Title: &lt;strong&gt;Resolution for the Conclusion and Investigation of Mass Surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Protecting the constitutional rights of residents and calling for a congressional investigation into mass surveillance activities.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution supporting the right to privacy, reminding agencies of the City and County of San Francisco that they are not permitted to conduct or assist in mass surveillance of private communications, urging law enforcement to respect the right to privacy, and requesting our United States Senators and members of Congress to both investigate past violations and prevent future violations of the Fourth and First Amendments of the United States Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, Privacy is a fundamental right reflected in the Constitution of the State of California Article 1 Section 1 and is further protected by the Fourth Amendment and other state and federal law; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, The right to privacy confers dignity and security to residents of the City and County of San Francisco, as well as protects the presumption of innocence underlying due process and their fundamental right to free speech, free association, and a free press; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, The Board of Supervisors passed Resolution 53-03 in 2003 instructing officials not to comply with the PATRIOT Act insofar as it allows violations of the rights of United States citizens; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, In 2006, Mark Klein exposed the National Security Agency’s mass interception of telecommunications at the AT&amp;amp;T building on 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, FISA Court decisions have revealed that federal agencies have in fact unconstitutionally violated the privacy of United States citizens by harvesting domestic communications, and the NSA has admitted to allowing analysts to use databases for personal use, and storing of all communication metadata, indicating a policy and culture of disregard of privacy rights within federal agencies; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, Federal agencies have incentivized cities to use surveillance against their residents, including in the City of Oakland which accepted federal funds for the Domain Awareness Center, and the City and County of San Francisco should not accept additional federal funds for unconstitutional surveillance projects; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, The City and County of San Francisco is a city of refuge for many individuals that suffer persecution, including by reason of religion, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, sexuality and gender identity, economic status, mental illness, and homelessness; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, Systemic violations of privacy have a chilling effect on free speech and freedom of association which protects and advances humanity, and systematic violations of privacy erode the presumption of innocence required by due process, now therefore, be it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED, That the residents of San Francisco strongly affirm our commitment to the rights and liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the State of California, and the United States Constitution, including the Fourth and First Amendments; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we ask federal and state law enforcement working within the City and County of San Francisco to work in accordance with local law including the right to privacy, free speech and freedom of association provided by the Constitution of the State of California and the United States Constitution; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED That the residents of San Francisco ask our United States Senators and members of Congress to launch a full independent congressional investigation into the intelligence community’s unconstitutional mass surveillance and hold individuals and agencies accountable for violations of the Fourth and First Amendments, and to restore fundamental rights and liberties embodied in the Constitution of the State of California and the United States Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Supervisors shall immediately send copies of this resolution to our United States Senators and members of Congress, the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the United States Attorney General, and the President of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Ironing Board Democracy Letter-Writing Campaign</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/19/ironing-board-democracy-letter-writing-campaign/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/19/ironing-board-democracy-letter-writing-campaign</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to get involved with the political side of the blanket surveillance issue, here&#39;s an opportunity for you!  I (Kenji) am looking for volunteers to join me in staffing an ironing board at an intersection with lots of foot traffic in Vallejo, Benicia, or Santa Rosa. The first location will probably be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcfma.com/market_home.php?market_id=19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vallejo Farmers&#39; Market&lt;/a&gt; (9am-1pm Saturdays).&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this ironing board station:  to invite passers-by to write actual pen-and-paper letters to Representative Mike Thompson, asking him to stand up for the Fourth Amendment in the future instead of defending the NSA&#39;s surveillance programs as he has done so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll bring the materials:  the ironing board, envelopes, paper, pens, stamps, mailing addresses of Rep. Thompson and other Bay Area members of Congress, at least one sample letter text for people to copy or adapt, and a stack of flyers explaining the blanket surveillance issue and who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring yourself, a readiness to be friendly and outgoing to our fellow citizens in the 5th Congressional District, and maybe some catchy lines to attract people to our station.  If you have a smartphone, that would be helpful for looking up addresses of any other officials whom people want to write letters to.  (My phone is of the dumb variety.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can provide a ride from and to anywhere in the East Bay, including Contra Costa County.  If interested, please leave a comment at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourthSF/comments/1krrax/ironing_board_democracy_plan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reddit page for this project.  More details are available there. &lt;/a&gt;Let me know how to contact you and when you&#39;re available.  I welcome suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visiting Pelosi's Office</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/18/visiting-pelosis-office/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/18/visiting-pelosis-office</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-frame aligncenter&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;assets/1116226_10200863643007633_1209147119_o.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 26, 2013 at 4pm, a group of organizations and individuals, including Restore the Fourth SF, representing the broad StopWatching.Us coalition met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi&#39;s chief of staff in San Francisco, Dan Bernal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coalition representing StopWatching.Us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracy Rosenberg, Media Alliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jennifer Granick, Stanford Law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark Jaycox, EFF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anna Salem, ACLU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt Lockshin, Credo Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan, Hackers and Founders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nadia Kayyali, Bill of Rights Defense Committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Poon, Restore the Fourth SF&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 45 minutes, the coalition members covered the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want an end to Section 215 phone metadata collection, an end to Section 702 internet data collection, and transparency, including a release of secret court opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want a complete change, not tweaks. Specifically…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want bulk collection to be stopped right now. That may take away some valuable capabilities/it may be a blunt thing, but it&#39;s gone so far wrong that it needs to stop right now — especially since we don&#39;t know the full scope of what&#39;s been going wrong. Specific capabilities can possibly be reinstated after, but bulk collection as it exists now must stop immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulk collection and our principles/privacy/checks and balances are fundamentally at odds. The FISA Court doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to hear a clear statement of principles from Pelosi on the matter that we can hold her to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution to the surveillance overreach will likely come in several bills, since most likely, no one bill will nix all the concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The surveillance hurts SF economics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelosi needs to hold town halls and speak to constituents. Tele-town halls are okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Briefly: A mention of better whistleblower protections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Briefly: The traditional FISA (before FISA Amendments Act of 2008) was actually better for privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were there, I also delivered the public comments on the NSA scandal that we gathered at our August 4th event (pictured above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelosi&#39;s office responded with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are a foreign policy office, not a legislative office, so they cannot comment on specifics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelosi wants action in the fall. She will not wait for bill reauthorization (2015).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelosi/her office has not stonewalled us or anyone else on this issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelosi voted against the Amash Amendment because it was too blunt of an instrument. It was the wrong vehicle for change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard fare: Pelosi has always had a strong position on privacy. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 did many good things for privacy. Et cetera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, of course, were not able to extract any specific promises, but we clearly and strongly communicated what was necessary to fix this mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One coalition attendee, Tracy Rosenberg from Media Alliance, described it like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quickest way to describe the 45-minute meeting is as a tug-of-war between two ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) blanket surveillance is fundamentally unconstitutional and needs to stop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) NSA surveillance programs need to be tweaked to rein in some level of over-reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelosi&#39;s office has agreed to meet with the coalition again when bills have moved further along the legislative cycle. They also gave us a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ik9zm4kzil0xnn2/FS60D_s_A4&quot;&gt;summary of the public statements&lt;/a&gt; Pelosi&#39;s made, including an open letter to Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The City Council Project</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/17/the-city-council-project/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/17/the-city-council-project</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The city council project aims to have city councils in the Bay Area pass primarily non-binding resolutions condemning the mass surveillance revealed by the Snowden leaks. The purpose of these resolutions is to provide public pressure from a local level to Congressional representatives whose districts include those cities. The work of this project is primarily in drafting the resolution, reaching out to partner organizations who may want to support the resolution, and working with city councils to pass the resolution.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A success story on which we are partially modeling our efforts after is at Matthew Mahoney&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailydot.com/politics/matthew-mahoney-nsa-metadata-spy-resolution/&quot;&gt;one-man fight&lt;/a&gt; to get localities in his area to pass the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. We start by identifying cities, city council meeting times, sympathetic council members and so on. We coordinate using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApWG2DmCnC7EdFdHbzdnZGVzeF95QjI5bmhIek1ZTFE&amp;amp;usp=sharing.&quot;&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your city is already on the spreadsheet:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
First, add your name to Column B of your city&#39;s column. You can use your first name only if you want, or even just put a +1 at the end of it if you&#39;re very sensitive about your name being on this spreadsheet. We will have more pull with city councils where we have more constituents. Then, fill in as many empty cells for your city as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your city is not already on the spreadsheet:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fill in the cells as best as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Next, the resolution text has to be written. This process is at different stages depending on the locality. Some localities, such as San Francisco, demand more city-specific text. Simultaneously, we need to get other organizations involved and alert the relevant city council. To get involved in these efforts, email restorefoursf@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where we are now&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;We have primarily concentrated our efforts on San Francisco, although other cities in the Bay Area are definitely on our radar. Anyone interested in spearheading an effort in their city would be welcome! The SF resolution text is being finalized, and we are in touch with a network of organizations and the SF Board of Supervisors regarding the resolution. In the coming weeks, we expect to send drafts to organizations for comment and with a request to sign on. Then, we will propose the resolution to the Board of Supervisors through a primary sponsor supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Follow up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For any questions or to get involved, email restorefoursf@gmail.com!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technoactivism Third Mondays at the EFF</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/17/technoactivism-third-mondays-at-the-eff/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/17/technoactivism-third-mondays-at-the-eff</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of some of the discussion at the EFF! Quotes are unattributed, sorry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openitp.org/doku.php?id=events%3Atechno-activism_3rd_mondays&quot;&gt;https://wiki.openitp.org/doku.php?id=events%3Atechno-activism_3rd_mondays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should distinguish between different threat levels because they require different levels of encryption security. We also have to be aware that the threat level only increases if your content is &quot;worthwhile enough&quot; so a way to avoid needing further encryption protection would be to avoid being noticed as worthwhile. The key to that is to hide metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat level concept eventually breaks down, however, because in order to communicate outside the secure group, you are immediately downgraded to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;lowest common denominator&lt;/span&gt;&quot; encryption techniques.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One goal could be to resist the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;chilling effect&lt;/span&gt; of NSA surveillance. Encryption should be universally used, and always end to end, to prevent First Amendment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, though, the NSA always prefers passive attacks over active ones. Passive attaches are cheaper, less noticeable. End to end encryption is the way to protect from passive attacks. It might not protect against active attacks (targetting). SO we can FORCE the NSA to do active attacks, explicitly targeting a defined threat, by using encryption - trap them into fishing with a rod instead of a net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTPS is a part of end to end encryption and relying on it would kill some NSA data collection programs alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to threat models, though - everyone is working with a different one. If by some unfortunate circumstance you are being &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;ACTIVELY targeted&lt;/span&gt; by the NSA, you just have to throw away all of your computers. And some people have done that. For us, that&#39;s not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your threat model is &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Ability to publis&lt;/span&gt;h&quot; and issues of censorship, let&#39;s say in a country like Iran or Syria, it&#39;s easier to protect you. The EFF software designers have a customer base of publishers in oppressive regimes. But we have to understand what the threats are, what techniques of surveillance and attack are being used, before we know what software we need to build. The EFF is 2-3 months away from producing this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally reduce your footprint to protect yourself as well, less data needs to be encrypted if less of it is available. Don&#39;t necessarily throw away all your computers, but find a way to limit how much personal data is transmitted through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Government Surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are foreign governments acquiring surveillance technologies? They&#39;re basically buying them off the shelf. They have no internal talent, it&#39;s basically an &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;arms trade&lt;/span&gt;. Currently it&#39;s so crude that the target can actually see what they are doing. They&#39;re buying DDOS botnets for example, to target individual journalists, or hiring freelance hackers to create malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surveillance systems that are for sale will become more and more sophisticated and harder to detect. And internationally there is almost no structural protection against this tool. We&#39;re actually a LOT safer in the US because we even have these privacy laws in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;off-the-shelf surveillance products&lt;/span&gt; are a justification for the NSA activity. The US government&#39;s optimal position is to make sure no foreign governments can surveil their citizenry, but that they have full access. Therefore, their technology must be infinitely superior to whats available elswhere. They need an assymetry betwen what the US can do and what our enemies can do. That&#39;s the justification. Only the US government can invade the privacy of US citizens, esentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Data at rest&lt;/span&gt;&quot; questions - once the data is stored on a server that&#39;s a security issue too. Passive data collection requires data on the move. But data at rest is much more protected in the US than elsewhere. That&#39;s why PRISM ignited fear globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do the laws work in other countries? Caroline uses &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;GCHQ&lt;/span&gt; in Britain as an example. They claim the right to access any data that travels through underseas cables under &quot;RIPA&quot; law. It&#39;s irrelevant who sent or received it, even if it&#39;s an entirely domestic communication it might still bounce to these underseas cables.  That&#39;s less protection than in the US, at least FISA appears to require one end be outside the US, and even US citizens outside the US have some protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using v. Collecting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question is, how are they using this data? Isn&#39;t that what we&#39;re really worried about? Even the collection of the data is unconstitutional, none of the constraints that the fourth amendment is interpreted to provide apply to collection at all. Restore the Fourth&#39;s resolution, for example, is solely about collection - it&#39;s also very hard to prove that the data is being used. Efficiency suggests that the use is in fact limited to targets in some way. But there are no good examples yet - it would expose NSA&#39;s capabilities if they admitted where they got the  evidence. So for example the DEA will construct &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;a second chain of evidence&lt;/span&gt; afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use in a civil subpoena context? The ECPA prevents private companies from giving out more than just the basic IP address type information. Also, they might not provide the data because it&#39;s a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Aside&lt;/strong&gt;: Look into the&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; forward security protection &lt;/a&gt;technique. This involves using different keys for every communication and then destroying them after the communication has been read. Like a digital &quot;&#39;burn after reading.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Encryption Tips: Text Messages</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/01/encryption-tips-text-messages/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/01/encryption-tips-text-messages</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob asked me to share his writeup of the cell phone class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat in on the android phone security break out group. To keep it simple, I&#39;ll just say a little bit about the apps for secure text and voice. They are both pretty easy to install and use.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For text messages go to the App Store and download Text Secure, setup is easy, follow the prompts. Once you have exchanged a key with someone also using it, every text you send them will be encrypted. Easiest way to verify each other is in person of course, it basically sends each person a hash tag, you can do this remotely but always easier and better to do when you are together. Using this app basically overrides your standard text client, any text you send will look for the recipient also using it. If they aren&#39;t , no biggie. It then is just a standard text. Once set up, it is completely transparent to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encrypted voice calls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the Red Phone app, simple to set up, again follow the prompts This works a little differently in use, it generates a one time key between the parties based on a 2 word pass phrase. Basically if you call someone also using red phone, you will each see a pass phrase, just say the phrase at the beginning of the call and then you are encrypted Again, pretty easy to use... Oh, one of the devs was there and I asked him about VoIP and yes, this works on that too. So if you use google voice or Skype, your voice calls will still be encrypted .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these apps are from whisper net and free to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, we did talk a bit about encrypting all of your phones data as well. Go to settings/security/encrypt device, follow the prompts. Encrypting all of your phones data will take some time, be sure you are plugged in to your charger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also discussed password security for your phone, it&#39;s kind of a balance there... Sure, a 40 character password is more secure but who wants to type that in every time you want to unlock your phone You should have one but its up to you how hard you want to make it for yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Encryption Tips: Email</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/01/encryption-tips-email/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/09/01/encryption-tips-email</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PGP Encryption taught by Will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;strong&gt;GPG, Mozilla Thunderbird, and a plugin called Enigmail&lt;/strong&gt;. PGP encryption was used by Glenn Greenwald and Snowden. It works with a pair of keys, a private and a public key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption is done by sequences of numbers, and you and your recipient have to share the same “cypher” for that. Simplest is Rot13, shift all the letters 13 spaces. And then you can change each letter by different increments, which creates much higher level of security. Then there&#39;s “Asymmetric encryption” - this is our method, it uses two keys, private and public. &lt;strong&gt;Someone can write you an email that’s encrypted by public key and can only be decrypted with your private key.&lt;/strong&gt; If you send an email to four people, it will be encrypted four times using their public keys.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the essential instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have downloaded the two applications and the plugin, you will go to the Thunderbird menu, find OpenPGP and select “Key Management” and generate a key with a very secure passcode/password. (There’s a dialogue box regarding revocation certificates, you can do that or wait til later). You will right click on the key in the Key Management window, and upload it to all the listed servers. Then once you exchange keys with another person, when you create an email, you can select encrypt by clicking on the key on the bottom right hand corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional security measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one way to circumvent this form of encryption is to create a third party intermediary between you and the other person (&quot;man in the middle&quot;). First they replace your public key with their public key and then decrypt it, then recrypt it using your correct public key and send it to the true recipient. Therefore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want your public key to be on many sites/in many places so that it can’t be replaced by someone else’s public key to get access to the communications. Use https websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to right click on a user’s key and select key properties, and read out the “&lt;strong&gt;fingerprint&lt;/strong&gt;” (a summary of the key) in person to verify that you have the correct public key. If one byte is changed in the public key, it gives a different fingerprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when private keys are compromised? “key revocation certificate” creates a centralized way to inform people not to use the public key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use encryption to sign the email and even a recipient who does not have your public key will know it’s sent by you. That’s a separate feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple keys, and transitioning to new keys: You should begin to transition to new keys in advance, and use it to sign emails that are encrypted using the old key. Then, when you revoke the old key, people know that the new key is from the same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Lightning Talks at the Public School</title>
      <link>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/08/31/lightning-talks-at-the-public-school/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/blog/2013/08/31/lightning-talks-at-the-public-school</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Public School/Sudo Room are located in a community space that’s open to all. They hosted a series of short talks.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Data&lt;/strong&gt; talk, we no longer need to process data before storing it because the storage is so cheap, that’s a sea change – just store it all and figure it out later when the technology to process it is available. Loading and unloading can be the most limiting factor/it’s a bottleneck. SO you want that storage to be the analytic platform reducing loading and unloading. Microsegmentation becomes possible. Predictive analytics and machine learning is the new way to find insider trading because they&#39;re always ahead of regulators, they&#39;ll use it at the NSA too. Data is never thrown away so they can always rerun the algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAC&lt;/strong&gt; in Oakland, an organization hosted a walking tour. Economic reasons drove these decisions, we always should ask what is the economic result? Target is poor people and people of color, how does it impact those populations. More than just cameras - digital data as well, overlay maps with people watching the feeds. And shared with the Fusion centers. Voho mobile phone system to map surveillance via mms. Send photos to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:icu@vojo.co&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;icu@vojo.co&lt;/a&gt; with %[address]. &lt;a href=&quot;http://vojo.co/icu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://vojo.co/icu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;East Bay Mesh&lt;/strong&gt; (presented by Sudo Room’s Jenny &amp;amp; colleague). Big local network of wifis talking together. Community owned infrastructure. Buy a wifi router and replace the operating system with theirs, install mesh protocol batman. Connection to internet is the complicated part. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N&lt;/a&gt;. not Tor but uses something related. Relay nodes, exit notes, these hide your source IP so that you don’t become liable for mesh use of your internet. OpenWRT is the router operating system, Batman advanced protocol. Creating the 501(c)(3). Looking for volunteers, doing classes and workshops, you can help out on Thursday nights. Network is separate from the nonprofit, they’re helping support nodes, and then peering agreements for self-supported ones. Raised money for first 100 nodes (routers and antennas). Meshmap.sudoroom.org to map antennas. IRC: Freenode #510pen. How do we connect Oakland and SF? Internet connection to SF using dark fiber, they are talking to Internet Archive about doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Activism&lt;/strong&gt; from Danny O’Brien, example is the cryptoparty earlier in the day. Security activism is what allows other forms of activism to exist - they all rely on privacy. Digital security politics: the history. They know everything and you know nothing. Digital security is personal, technological and political. They’re all interrelated. Danny is the international director. They’re using their experience from copyright to chart the progress of the surveillance debate. What can we do, hit above our weight, coalitions. Technological solutions. Personal feedback loops to show you have succeeded helped with copyright, and there’s no feedback from combatting surveillance. There are no visuals either. And the NSA is much worse as an enemy than the RIAA. We’re fighting for other people, so encryption isn’t helping them. NSA&#39;s secrecy might be their downfall, we have the advantage of openness. Private ownership of data is important.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;22 people present. Michael moderating.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 4th Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positives: speakers, Sina, Sam and EFF gets the credit. Videos, good sound system, whistles, sign table, positive relations with the police, anarchists were dissuaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;older attendees - this issue came up in the 60s, great we got older people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of attendees ~400 - but we want more people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traditional political activists do not feel there&#39;s a strong connection to this issue. new activists came, who were able to relate to it. not life and death. show them scenarios why it matters - blackmail (expressed in the negative: spying is ok as long as you&#39;ve never done anything wrong, you never will do anything wrong, and you love no-one). Cannibal cop in NY, actual abuse. UK politician, FBI agent book. Lots of details here. Value of rule of law to create a viceral response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of messages to be promoted at future events. Ads, media marketing. Make our message more concrete for bay area residents. Oakland, anarchist message. More flyers posted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outreach/Coalition Building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tea Party Kenji (East Bay) Ryan (South Bay).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin (Casey)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Cloud (Alex) with interest from Eric and Daniel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junior State of America covering northern California (Nick and Michael)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senior Center (Kyle and Kenji)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 18th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 99% Coalition event, rsvp at sf99percent at gmail. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 31st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sudoroom cryptoparty/EFF presentations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Labor Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Occupy SF group, thread on reddit, Facebook thread (Alice will post those)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email restorefourSF at gmail to get involved in specific Town Halls or contact Michael. Non-confrontational, relationship building and relationships that constitute influence closer to votes. [Side discussion on civil disobedience, contempt of court in tech companies].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Town Hall Santa Rosa, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aug 21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 3:30 pm Zaki is in charge. Thompson voted against Amash Amendment, involved with relevant committee. Of local representatives, he&#39;s the one we&#39;ve been most successful at reaching out to. Meeting with senior staff person, doing prep for it over the next day or so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recitation videos, some laypeople made theirs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/RestoreTheFourthsf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/user/RestoreTheFourthsf&lt;/a&gt; Should we expand our questions? After all, congress claims everything is legal. So we should ask them to define what&#39;s legal and not illegal, gets deeper into the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption options&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Silent Circle&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/the-truth-about-why-silent-circle-silenced-their-secure-email-service-7000019300/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/the-truth-about-why-silent-circle-silenced-their-secure-email-service-7000019300/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bit levels of encryption, alice to check with EFF to see if there is still an illegal level of encryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crypto party every 4th of every month, nationally, so that keys can&#39;t be traced to specific geographic areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric is organizing/administrating the cryptoparty. Expanding the mailing list. Whitepaper from Freedom of the Press foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/06/encryption-works-how-protect-your-privacy-age-nsa-surveillance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/06/encryption-works-how-protect-your-privacy-age-nsa-surveillance&lt;/a&gt; How do we reach out to laypeople: new name? Encryption Workshop. Typically very introductory. People bring their laptops. PGP, Redphone, encrypted text messages and phone calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing cryptoparties, we should collaborate with other groups. &quot;Cryptoparty SF&quot; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://cryptopartysf.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://cryptopartysf.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wes&#39;s honeypot project: Identified situations where access to data is abused. 611 Folsom is still filtering data, what about trying to get flagged, we can see if they try to access it on our server. Human rights activists are monitored, opportunity to reach out based on this. License plate readers, FOIA request for cars used by gov officials, and then use the videos to track. Existing private network of videos can be used to track the cars. Honey pots? It&#39;s hard to detect passive surveillance (tor was obvious) but detecting active attacks is easier. But active attacks prove passive surveillance. Isn&#39;t this counterproductive - not exactly an abuse to pursue a potential terrorist. Do we want to prove something that was already proven?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are forming a working group for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness of abusers is they have to recruit intelligent people, nsa recruiting tactics. Computer science professors are asking their students not to work there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting city councils to sign a nonbinding resolution. It&#39;s easy for them to do it, raises visibility in local areas and reaches out to normal people. Recitation videos too. Alice and Michael are going to do SF. Combining this with town hall groups. Combining this with town hall groups. Blueprint needs to be created. Get a list of city councils and their history, focus on districts with reps who voted in favor of the Amash Amendment. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/&lt;/a&gt; Data here &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob, street theater as fun outreach to individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meshnet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our meshnet person couldn’t be here, Alice is giving a vague overview. PM if you want to get in touch with him for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;thursdays at noisebridge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. PM for IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different levels of interest and involvement, I know some are put off by the high tech stuff, so I’ll separate it into three parts and then do questions. First, an overview all a meshnet does is encrypt between computers - no endpoint encryption/protection. Since everything is displayed on/typed into a computer without encryption, this depends on your computer itself being secure – we know windows has a keylogger for example. Three levels of interest are hardware-to-hardware meshnet (long term goal), internet based (hyberboria), and then layperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First; the ideal is hardware-to-hardware. Our project meshnet contact needs people who can contribute hardware and who understand hardware. His current transmitter is .5 miles and he lives near filmore and geary. If you want to set up your own meshlocal, you can talk to him. He has outlined several other hardware-to-hardware options…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o Two intro videos &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o We are using cjdns protocol for meshlocals in SF. cjdns=the software that runs on the nodes that are a part of hyperboria and/or meshnet. The batman protocol is being used in Oakland, sudoroom &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursdays&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to work on batman protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the meantime, if you just want to encrypt your communications, they are running cjdns over the internet. There’s an irc channel where you can get introduced to this. It’s called hyperboria. It is not ideal because it is not hardware to hardware but this is still a respectably secure way to communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o Both these methods make you a “node” which means it requires some processing power – but its not that bad. You can use hyperboria with your existing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o Currently only works with linux and mac, but they’re working on a windows version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, if you cannot run linux or figure out how to use irc… if that’s beyond you, we still will be looking for financial contributions and other ways to promote meshet, in the coming months, so you can sign up to support meshnet without being a user yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why meshnet? We might not have a choice, it may be too late to restore the fourth, and in the meantime. &quot;Meet people where they are, at their level, try to get them to engage one level higher.&quot; - Alex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branding? Meshnet will be mentioned at cryptoparties. We will vote later on whether we support meshnet as an organization (preliminary vote seems positive) once they&#39;ve looked into it further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location, seems like powell is the most convenient, two people came by caltrain so being near caltrain isn&#39;t that important. Seemed like it was diffcult for a few people to get here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a website (Daniel and Thawab, with some involvement from Ryan).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael as acting Regional Coordinator for 30 days and then we can reopen the issue. Ayes have it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alan update on national, gives an overview of how it started. There&#39;s an oversight committee, with local chapters represented with a low barrier to entry, event in last 90 days. Executives are elected. Mission of executive committee is being worked out. They want to buy restorethefourth.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST MEETING REVISIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgot to mention, Terms and Conditions May Apply, they&#39;re coming back to Oakland, August 20th at The New Parkway Theater &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenewparkway.com/index.php?date=08%2F20%2F13&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.thenewparkway.com/index.php?date=08%2F20%2F13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudoroom Cryptoparty now moved to Aug 31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people expressed interest in the personal cloud meeting: &lt;a href=&quot;http://personal-clouds.org/wiki/Personal_Clouds:Current_events&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://personal-clouds.org/wiki/Personal_Clouds:Current_events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PRESS STATEMENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For immediate release&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Restore the Fourth SF Prepares for Second Major Rally on Sunday, August 4th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seeks to build on momentum of July 4th protests with prominent guest speakers, enhance awareness of constitutional abuses, and encourage citizen participation&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Restore the Fourth — the grassroots, non-partisan, non-violent movement dedicated to ending all forms of unconstitutional surveillance of digital communications by the U.S. government — is preparing to hold its second major nationwide rally on Sunday, August 4th. The San Francisco chapter of Restore the Fourth will hold its rally at Justin Herman Plaza (at Market and Steuart) beginning at noon. Several prominent guest speakers, including whistleblowers Daniel Ellsberg and Mark Klein, will be in attendance.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This second rally follows the success of the July 4th, 2013 event, which saw tens of thousands of Americans turn out nationwide to raise awareness of unconstitutional surveillance, such as that employed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in its recently-revealed metadata collection and PRISM programs, and to encourage the cessation of all U.S. government surveillance that stands in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Approximately 400 people marched down Market Street in San Francisco on July 4th to voice their concerns over such issues. The event and guest speakers will aim to educate and increase awareness of the government’s spying initiatives and to encourage more Americans to take a stand in defense of their privacy. The rally will also address local elected representatives, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (of California’s 12th congressional district), focusing on those who have supported the NSA surveillance program.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During a recent vote in the House on an amendment that would have curbed the NSA’s spying powers championed by Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), for example, Congresswoman Pelosi voted against the amendment and for the unconstitutional NSA programs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the rally, participants will have the chance to express their individual concerns over privacy and government surveillance by adding Post-it notes to a public comment board. Following appearances by the guest speakers, the boards will be delivered to the San Francisco Federal Building, where Congresswoman Pelosi’s district office is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“We are holding this event to reinforce our previous point: That this incursion onto our privacy affects everyone — whether they are aware of the issue or not — and that there are enough people outraged at the actions of the government that there is a loud public outcry,” said Ryan Brown, an organizer within the San Francisco chapter of Restore the Fourth. “We are here to show the people of San Francisco, our elected officials, and the nation at large that there are individuals out there who care about everyone&#39;s right to privacy — and who are willing to fight for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco rally begins at 12pm in the Embarcadero Plaza. Guest speakers will be featured from 1-2pm. Among the speakers will be Daniel Ellsberg, who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers detailing controversial government secrets about the Vietnam War, and Mark Klein, the former AT&amp;amp;T technician who revealed in 2006 that the company was colluding with the NSA by diverting customer data through NSA collection filters — including one located in AT&amp;amp;T’s San Francisco office. Also present will be Norman Solomon, founder of the Institute for Public accuracy, which works to provide alternate information sources for journalists, and Jennifer Granick, Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Expected turnout for the rally is about 400 people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Restore the Fourth originated as a nationwide movement on social news website reddit.com in June 2013 in response to revelations of the U.S. government’s massive and unconstitutional surveillance programs. The organization has also established presences on Facebook (facebook.com/RestoreThe4thSF) and Twitter (twitter.com/RestoreThe4thSF); updates can be found on both sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part One: National Leadership; Over arching themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principles:Non-violence and separation of our other political stances from this particular issue so we can spread this message and reach out across the aisle.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Two: Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restoring hope to the people of the United States and helping them realize that they can change the course of the US government by coming out and supporting us in any manner they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWARENESS is our current primary goal. Grow our Active base by spreading the word via social networking and informative videos about the fourth amendment and why it is important as well as eventually a video project. (Currently looking for people who are very familiar with editing software.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about the renewal date of Metadata tracking. Keeping the issue in the media (while remaining mindful of the media&#39;s tendency toward vilifying our cause.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin to use (or continue to use) Non-Prism search engines. (Possibly stop using facebook and other social networking sites as a form of protest at some point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read up on our oppositions arguments and prepare counters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events each must provide net gain on momentum, or achieve something concrete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope, a chance to participate in government. Use fun events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicit exclusion of any partisan issue even one that individuals might associate with the 4th amendment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to fight an institutional consensus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bill of rights isn&#39;t a list of laws, it&#39;s a list of facts - of what the limits of a sustainable government are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agenda plus Alternative = change. We have an agenda, let&#39;s develop an alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Three: Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-5 scale on civil disobedience. Examples of success: PETA, montreal student movement 2012, civil rights movement (distinction of tangible issues). Abstraction? Civil rights can be tangible, even the 4th. Digital civil disobedience. After a vote, 23/25 agree: &lt;strong&gt;This group has generally agreed that we are not planning on using civil disobedience at this time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action: Cryptoparties, noisebridge as a location. in the mean time, a summary (Eric and Alan).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action: Organizing town hall type meetings in all Bay Area cities and counties. (We currently have ones in Santa Rosa and San Francisco in the works)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action: Videotaping project involves getting citizens, public figures and teachers to recite the fourth amendment on camera and then stating what the amendment means to them. (We eventually plan on editing all of these together to form a longer; yet still short documentary about the movement and the fourth amendment.) Youtube channel created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action: 8/4 2pm speakers at embarcadero, handing out flyers throughout market 11-2 (dressed up as NSA). Recordings? &quot;Proposed&quot; to be discussed on reddit, facebook. Preference for elected officials on embarcadero. government employees. Video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count the federal criminal laws?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressuring companies not to backdoor, alternative to direct government action? Boycotts? Pressuring employees? Thawab points out: targeting private companies may be too difficult because money drives that industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feinstein - for people who specifically want to approach the blight that is Feinstein, you have a massive resource in David Levitt. Contact him if you want to do anything related to that. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.levitt2012.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.levitt2012.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roles created: Video and Youtube team, Cryptoparty team, Town Hall teams, Feinstein specialist. Assigned responsibilities to the people who come to me with ideas or questions or skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
