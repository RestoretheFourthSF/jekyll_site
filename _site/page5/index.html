            <p><p>PRESS STATEMENT</p>
<p>For immediate release<br />
<br />
<strong>Restore the Fourth SF Prepares for Second Major Rally on Sunday, August 4th</strong><br />
<br />
Seeks to build on momentum of July 4th protests with prominent guest speakers, enhance awareness of constitutional abuses, and encourage citizen participation<br />
<br />
Restore the Fourth — the grassroots, non-partisan, non-violent movement dedicated to ending all forms of unconstitutional surveillance of digital communications by the U.S. government — is preparing to hold its second major nationwide rally on Sunday, August 4th. The San Francisco chapter of Restore the Fourth will hold its rally at Justin Herman Plaza (at Market and Steuart) beginning at noon. Several prominent guest speakers, including whistleblowers Daniel Ellsberg and Mark Klein, will be in attendance.<!--more--><br />
<br />
This second rally follows the success of the July 4th, 2013 event, which saw tens of thousands of Americans turn out nationwide to raise awareness of unconstitutional surveillance, such as that employed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in its recently-revealed metadata collection and PRISM programs, and to encourage the cessation of all U.S. government surveillance that stands in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Approximately 400 people marched down Market Street in San Francisco on July 4th to voice their concerns over such issues. The event and guest speakers will aim to educate and increase awareness of the government’s spying initiatives and to encourage more Americans to take a stand in defense of their privacy. The rally will also address local elected representatives, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (of California’s 12th congressional district), focusing on those who have supported the NSA surveillance program.<br />
<br />
During a recent vote in the House on an amendment that would have curbed the NSA’s spying powers championed by Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), for example, Congresswoman Pelosi voted against the amendment and for the unconstitutional NSA programs.<br />
<br />
At the rally, participants will have the chance to express their individual concerns over privacy and government surveillance by adding Post-it notes to a public comment board. Following appearances by the guest speakers, the boards will be delivered to the San Francisco Federal Building, where Congresswoman Pelosi’s district office is.<br />
<br />
“We are holding this event to reinforce our previous point: That this incursion onto our privacy affects everyone — whether they are aware of the issue or not — and that there are enough people outraged at the actions of the government that there is a loud public outcry,” said Ryan Brown, an organizer within the San Francisco chapter of Restore the Fourth. “We are here to show the people of San Francisco, our elected officials, and the nation at large that there are individuals out there who care about everyone's right to privacy — and who are willing to fight for it.”</p>
<p>The San Francisco rally begins at 12pm in the Embarcadero Plaza. Guest speakers will be featured from 1-2pm. Among the speakers will be Daniel Ellsberg, who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers detailing controversial government secrets about the Vietnam War, and Mark Klein, the former AT&amp;T technician who revealed in 2006 that the company was colluding with the NSA by diverting customer data through NSA collection filters — including one located in AT&amp;T’s San Francisco office. Also present will be Norman Solomon, founder of the Institute for Public accuracy, which works to provide alternate information sources for journalists, and Jennifer Granick, Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.<br />
<br />
Expected turnout for the rally is about 400 people.<br />
<br />
Restore the Fourth originated as a nationwide movement on social news website reddit.com in June 2013 in response to revelations of the U.S. government’s massive and unconstitutional surveillance programs. The organization has also established presences on Facebook (facebook.com/RestoreThe4thSF) and Twitter (twitter.com/RestoreThe4thSF); updates can be found on both sites.</p>

            <p><div>
<div>
<p><strong>Part One: National Leadership; Over arching themes</strong></p>
<p>Principles:Non-violence and separation of our other political stances from this particular issue so we can spread this message and reach out across the aisle.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Goals</strong></p>
<p>Restoring hope to the people of the United States and helping them realize that they can change the course of the US government by coming out and supporting us in any manner they can.</p>
<p>AWARENESS is our current primary goal. Grow our Active base by spreading the word via social networking and informative videos about the fourth amendment and why it is important as well as eventually a video project. (Currently looking for people who are very familiar with editing software.)</p>
<p>Talking about the renewal date of Metadata tracking. Keeping the issue in the media (while remaining mindful of the media's tendency toward vilifying our cause.)</p>
<p>Begin to use (or continue to use) Non-Prism search engines. (Possibly stop using facebook and other social networking sites as a form of protest at some point.)</p>
<p>Read up on our oppositions arguments and prepare counters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Events each must provide net gain on momentum, or achieve something concrete.</li>
<li>Hope, a chance to participate in government. Use fun events.</li>
<li>Explicit exclusion of any partisan issue even one that individuals might associate with the 4th amendment.</li>
<li>What does it mean to fight an institutional consensus?</li>
<li>The bill of rights isn't a list of laws, it's a list of facts - of what the limits of a sustainable government are.</li>
<li>Agenda plus Alternative = change. We have an agenda, let's develop an alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part Three: Actions</strong></p>
<p>1-5 scale on civil disobedience. Examples of success: PETA, montreal student movement 2012, civil rights movement (distinction of tangible issues). Abstraction? Civil rights can be tangible, even the 4th. Digital civil disobedience. After a vote, 23/25 agree: <strong>This group has generally agreed that we are not planning on using civil disobedience at this time.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Cryptoparties, noisebridge as a location. in the mean time, a summary (Eric and Alan).</li>
<li>Action: Organizing town hall type meetings in all Bay Area cities and counties. (We currently have ones in Santa Rosa and San Francisco in the works)</li>
<li>Action: Videotaping project involves getting citizens, public figures and teachers to recite the fourth amendment on camera and then stating what the amendment means to them. (We eventually plan on editing all of these together to form a longer; yet still short documentary about the movement and the fourth amendment.) Youtube channel created.</li>
<li>Action: 8/4 2pm speakers at embarcadero, handing out flyers throughout market 11-2 (dressed up as NSA). Recordings? "Proposed" to be discussed on reddit, facebook. Preference for elected officials on embarcadero. government employees. Video</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Count the federal criminal laws?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pressuring companies not to backdoor, alternative to direct government action? Boycotts? Pressuring employees? Thawab points out: targeting private companies may be too difficult because money drives that industry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Feinstein - for people who specifically want to approach the blight that is Feinstein, you have a massive resource in David Levitt. Contact him if you want to do anything related to that. <a href="http://www.levitt2012.org/" target="_blank">http://www.levitt2012.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Roles created: Video and Youtube team, Cryptoparty team, Town Hall teams, Feinstein specialist. Assigned responsibilities to the people who come to me with ideas or questions or skills.</p>
