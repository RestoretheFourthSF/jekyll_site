<p><strong>Part One: National Leadership; Over arching themes</strong></p>
<p>Principles:Non-violence and separation of our other political stances from this particular issue so we can spread this message and reach out across the aisle.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Goals</strong></p>
<p>Restoring hope to the people of the United States and helping them realize that they can change the course of the US government by coming out and supporting us in any manner they can.</p>
<p>AWARENESS is our current primary goal. Grow our Active base by spreading the word via social networking and informative videos about the fourth amendment and why it is important as well as eventually a video project. (Currently looking for people who are very familiar with editing software.)</p>
<p>Talking about the renewal date of Metadata tracking. Keeping the issue in the media (while remaining mindful of the media's tendency toward vilifying our cause.)</p>
<p>Begin to use (or continue to use) Non-Prism search engines. (Possibly stop using facebook and other social networking sites as a form of protest at some point.)</p>
<p>Read up on our oppositions arguments and prepare counters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Events each must provide net gain on momentum, or achieve something concrete.</li>
<li>Hope, a chance to participate in government. Use fun events.</li>
<li>Explicit exclusion of any partisan issue even one that individuals might associate with the 4th amendment.</li>
<li>What does it mean to fight an institutional consensus?</li>
<li>The bill of rights isn't a list of laws, it's a list of facts - of what the limits of a sustainable government are.</li>
<li>Agenda plus Alternative = change. We have an agenda, let's develop an alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part Three: Actions</strong></p>
<p>1-5 scale on civil disobedience. Examples of success: PETA, montreal student movement 2012, civil rights movement (distinction of tangible issues). Abstraction? Civil rights can be tangible, even the 4th. Digital civil disobedience. After a vote, 23/25 agree: <strong>This group has generally agreed that we are not planning on using civil disobedience at this time.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Cryptoparties, noisebridge as a location. in the mean time, a summary (Eric and Alan).</li>
<li>Action: Organizing town hall type meetings in all Bay Area cities and counties. (We currently have ones in Santa Rosa and San Francisco in the works)</li>
<li>Action: Videotaping project involves getting citizens, public figures and teachers to recite the fourth amendment on camera and then stating what the amendment means to them. (We eventually plan on editing all of these together to form a longer; yet still short documentary about the movement and the fourth amendment.) Youtube channel created.</li>
<li>Action: 8/4 2pm speakers at embarcadero, handing out flyers throughout market 11-2 (dressed up as NSA). Recordings? "Proposed" to be discussed on reddit, facebook. Preference for elected officials on embarcadero. government employees. Video</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Count the federal criminal laws?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pressuring companies not to backdoor, alternative to direct government action? Boycotts? Pressuring employees? Thawab points out: targeting private companies may be too difficult because money drives that industry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Feinstein - for people who specifically want to approach the blight that is Feinstein, you have a massive resource in David Levitt. Contact him if you want to do anything related to that. <a href="http://www.levitt2012.org/" target="_blank">http://www.levitt2012.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Roles created: Video and Youtube team, Cryptoparty team, Town Hall teams, Feinstein specialist. Assigned responsibilities to the people who come to me with ideas or questions or skills.</p>
