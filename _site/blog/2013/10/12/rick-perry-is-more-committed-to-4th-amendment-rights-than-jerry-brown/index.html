<p>Today (October 12th, 2013) Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a bill that was designed to protect California residents' privacy and freedom of thought. <a href="leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB467">SB 467</a> requires a warrant for state and local law enforcement to demand access to the electronic communications of any person. This would include your Gmail account or Facebook message history. Here is some <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/sb-467-californias-email-privacy-bill" target="_blank">further background provided by the EFF</a>. Under current law, no warrant is required for messages older than 30 days under what is known as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/deep-dive-updating-electronic-communications-privacy-act">"third party doctrine"</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>SB 467 was put forward by Senator Mark Leno and is the second electronic privacy bill vetoed by Governor Brown. The first was SB 1434 in 2012 which would have required a warrant before a phone, computer or tablet could be searched. Thanks to the revelations uncovered by Edward Snowden, we now know that federal government surveils the electronic communications of all Americans and shares that information with state and local law enforcement at their discretion. SB 467 would prevent Calfornia's law enforcement from using information obtained unconstitutionally either at their request or provided at the federal level.</p>
<p>Governor Brown's<a href="http://gov.ca.gov/docs/SB_467_2013_Veto_Message.pdf"> veto statement </a>is factually inaccurate and indicates poor judgement on this issue.. We have ample evidence that the federal government is obtaining email without a warrant. It was the subject of a <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2010/04/13">Yahoo lawsuit</a> trying to stop this activity.  Not to mention unknowndragnet surveillance of electronic communications approved by the FISA court (or not, maybe). The 3 day notice that Governor Brown objects to is essentially the same as Texas's vanguard <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/dont-mess-texas-email-state-law-ends-some-warrantless-email-6C10370211">email privacy law</a>. Governor Perry signed this law in June 2013.</p>

<p>I believe that the legislature has ample grounds to override Governor Brown's veto. That should be the next step, and we hope you will contact your state senators and assemblymen on Monday to ask for a legislative override. He's given us a gift by providing us with an additional day to prepare this avalanche.</p>
