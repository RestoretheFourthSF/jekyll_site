    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Generally, the search and seizure of physical property or a home without a warrant is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2236">punishable as a federal crime</a>. The punishment is a year in jail, even for someone acting on behalf of the government. This is the last stronghold of the Fourth Amendment.<!--more--></p>
<p>Regarding communications, there is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119">a separate provision</a>. Within that, there is a provision <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511">requiring warrants for the interception of electronic communications</a> which carries a sentence of five years, or alternately a paltry $500 civil fine. However, that provision is eviscerated by a big "notwithstanding" provision:</p>
<blockquote><p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title or section 705 or 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, it shall not be unlawful for an officer, employee, or agent of the United States in the normal course of his official duty to conduct electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as authorized by that Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>And a later provision allows them to have foreign governments do their dirty work for them, for example Britain intercepting underseas cables without restriction by fourth amendment rights:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing contained in this chapter or chapter 121 or 206 of this title, or section 705 of the Communications Act of 1934, shall be deemed to affect the acquisition by the United States Government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications, or foreign intelligence activities conducted in accordance with otherwise applicable Federal law involving a foreign electronic communications system, utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no provision barring government storage of information (once lawfully intercepted of course). FISA is in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-36">Title 50, Chapter 36 </a>of the code. As we know, FISA permits rubber stamped general warrants. However, the application of FISA is limited to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801" target="_blank">specific circumstances</a>, most notably:</p>
<blockquote><p>(e) “Foreign intelligence information” means—</p>
<p>(1) information that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to, the ability of the United States to protect against—</p>
<p>(A) actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;</p>
<p>(B) sabotage, international terrorism, or the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or</p>
<p>(C) clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by an agent of a foreign power; or</p>
<p>(2) information with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to—</p>
<p>(A) the national defense or the security of the United States; or</p>
<p>(B) the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>When data is collected via dragnet/bulk interception, most of the data still falls outside FISA. Therefore, the criminal sanctions that should be placed on the NSA and its co-conspirators  are lengthy. In addition, FISA only permits storage for up to one year if collected without even a FISA warrant. Violations lead to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1809">five years in jail or a fine of $10,000</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And lo! How the provisions for spying on other spies became used.</p>
