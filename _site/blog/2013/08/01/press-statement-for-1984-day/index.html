<strong>Restore the Fourth SF Prepares for Second Major Rally on Sunday, August 4th</strong><br />
<br />
Seeks to build on momentum of July 4th protests with prominent guest speakers, enhance awareness of constitutional abuses, and encourage citizen participation<br />
<br />
Restore the Fourth — the grassroots, non-partisan, non-violent movement dedicated to ending all forms of unconstitutional surveillance of digital communications by the U.S. government — is preparing to hold its second major nationwide rally on Sunday, August 4th. The San Francisco chapter of Restore the Fourth will hold its rally at Justin Herman Plaza (at Market and Steuart) beginning at noon. Several prominent guest speakers, including whistleblowers Daniel Ellsberg and Mark Klein, will be in attendance.<!--more--><br />
<br />
This second rally follows the success of the July 4th, 2013 event, which saw tens of thousands of Americans turn out nationwide to raise awareness of unconstitutional surveillance, such as that employed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in its recently-revealed metadata collection and PRISM programs, and to encourage the cessation of all U.S. government surveillance that stands in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Approximately 400 people marched down Market Street in San Francisco on July 4th to voice their concerns over such issues. The event and guest speakers will aim to educate and increase awareness of the government’s spying initiatives and to encourage more Americans to take a stand in defense of their privacy. The rally will also address local elected representatives, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (of California’s 12th congressional district), focusing on those who have supported the NSA surveillance program.<br />
<br />
During a recent vote in the House on an amendment that would have curbed the NSA’s spying powers championed by Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), for example, Congresswoman Pelosi voted against the amendment and for the unconstitutional NSA programs.<br />
<br />
At the rally, participants will have the chance to express their individual concerns over privacy and government surveillance by adding Post-it notes to a public comment board. Following appearances by the guest speakers, the boards will be delivered to the San Francisco Federal Building, where Congresswoman Pelosi’s district office is.<br />
<br />
“We are holding this event to reinforce our previous point: That this incursion onto our privacy affects everyone — whether they are aware of the issue or not — and that there are enough people outraged at the actions of the government that there is a loud public outcry,” said Ryan Brown, an organizer within the San Francisco chapter of Restore the Fourth. “We are here to show the people of San Francisco, our elected officials, and the nation at large that there are individuals out there who care about everyone's right to privacy — and who are willing to fight for it.”</p>
<p>The San Francisco rally begins at 12pm in the Embarcadero Plaza. Guest speakers will be featured from 1-2pm. Among the speakers will be Daniel Ellsberg, who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers detailing controversial government secrets about the Vietnam War, and Mark Klein, the former AT&amp;T technician who revealed in 2006 that the company was colluding with the NSA by diverting customer data through NSA collection filters — including one located in AT&amp;T’s San Francisco office. Also present will be Norman Solomon, founder of the Institute for Public accuracy, which works to provide alternate information sources for journalists, and Jennifer Granick, Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.<br />
<br />
Expected turnout for the rally is about 400 people.<br />
<br />
Restore the Fourth originated as a nationwide movement on social news website reddit.com in June 2013 in response to revelations of the U.S. government’s massive and unconstitutional surveillance programs. The organization has also established presences on Facebook (facebook.com/RestoreThe4thSF) and Twitter (twitter.com/RestoreThe4thSF); updates can be found on both sites.</p>
