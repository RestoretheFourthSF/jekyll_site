<p><strong>Meshnet</strong></p>
<p>Our meshnet person couldn’t be here, Alice is giving a vague overview. PM if you want to get in touch with him for <strong><em>thursdays at noisebridge</em></strong>. PM for IRC.</p>
<p>There are different levels of interest and involvement, I know some are put off by the high tech stuff, so I’ll separate it into three parts and then do questions. First, an overview all a meshnet does is encrypt between computers - no endpoint encryption/protection. Since everything is displayed on/typed into a computer without encryption, this depends on your computer itself being secure – we know windows has a keylogger for example. Three levels of interest are hardware-to-hardware meshnet (long term goal), internet based (hyberboria), and then layperson.</p>
<ul>
<li>First; the ideal is hardware-to-hardware. Our project meshnet contact needs people who can contribute hardware and who understand hardware. His current transmitter is .5 miles and he lives near filmore and geary. If you want to set up your own meshlocal, you can talk to him. He has outlined several other hardware-to-hardware options…</li>
</ul>
<p>o Two intro videos <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch" target="_blank">http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s</a></p>
<p>o We are using cjdns protocol for meshlocals in SF. cjdns=the software that runs on the nodes that are a part of hyperboria and/or meshnet. The batman protocol is being used in Oakland, sudoroom <strong><em>Thursdays</em></strong> to work on batman protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the meantime, if you just want to encrypt your communications, they are running cjdns over the internet. There’s an irc channel where you can get introduced to this. It’s called hyperboria. It is not ideal because it is not hardware to hardware but this is still a respectably secure way to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>o Both these methods make you a “node” which means it requires some processing power – but its not that bad. You can use hyperboria with your existing hardware.</p>
<p>o Currently only works with linux and mac, but they’re working on a windows version.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third, if you cannot run linux or figure out how to use irc… if that’s beyond you, we still will be looking for financial contributions and other ways to promote meshet, in the coming months, so you can sign up to support meshnet without being a user yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why meshnet? We might not have a choice, it may be too late to restore the fourth, and in the meantime. "Meet people where they are, at their level, try to get them to engage one level higher." - Alex</p>
<ul>
<li>Branding? Meshnet will be mentioned at cryptoparties. We will vote later on whether we support meshnet as an organization (preliminary vote seems positive) once they've looked into it further.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location, seems like powell is the most convenient, two people came by caltrain so being near caltrain isn't that important. Seemed like it was diffcult for a few people to get here.</li>
<li>Making a website (Daniel and Thawab, with some involvement from Ryan).</li>
<li>Michael as acting Regional Coordinator for 30 days and then we can reopen the issue. Ayes have it.</li>
<li>Alan update on national, gives an overview of how it started. There's an oversight committee, with local chapters represented with a low barrier to entry, event in last 90 days. Executives are elected. Mission of executive committee is being worked out. They want to buy restorethefourth.com.</li>

<li>Wes's honeypot project: Identified situations where access to data is abused. 611 Folsom is still filtering data, what about trying to get flagged, we can see if they try to access it on our server. Human rights activists are monitored, opportunity to reach out based on this. License plate readers, FOIA request for cars used by gov officials, and then use the videos to track. Existing private network of videos can be used to track the cars. Honey pots? It's hard to detect passive surveillance (tor was obvious) but detecting active attacks is easier. But active attacks prove passive surveillance. Isn't this counterproductive - not exactly an abuse to pursue a potential terrorist. Do we want to prove something that was already proven?</li>
</ul>
<p>We are forming a working group for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weakness of abusers is they have to recruit intelligent people, nsa recruiting tactics. Computer science professors are asking their students not to work there.</li>
<li>Getting city councils to sign a nonbinding resolution. It's easy for them to do it, raises visibility in local areas and reaches out to normal people. Recitation videos too. Alice and Michael are going to do SF. Combining this with town hall groups. Combining this with town hall groups. Blueprint needs to be created. Get a list of city councils and their history, focus on districts with reps who voted in favor of the Amash Amendment. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/</a> Data here <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing</a></li>

<p><strong>Meshnet</strong></p>
<p>Our meshnet person couldn’t be here, Alice is giving a vague overview. PM if you want to get in touch with him for <strong><em>thursdays at noisebridge</em></strong>. PM for IRC.</p>
<p>There are different levels of interest and involvement, I know some are put off by the high tech stuff, so I’ll separate it into three parts and then do questions. First, an overview all a meshnet does is encrypt between computers - no endpoint encryption/protection. Since everything is displayed on/typed into a computer without encryption, this depends on your computer itself being secure – we know windows has a keylogger for example. Three levels of interest are hardware-to-hardware meshnet (long term goal), internet based (hyberboria), and then layperson.</p>
<ul>
<li>First; the ideal is hardware-to-hardware. Our project meshnet contact needs people who can contribute hardware and who understand hardware. His current transmitter is .5 miles and he lives near filmore and geary. If you want to set up your own meshlocal, you can talk to him. He has outlined several other hardware-to-hardware options…</li>
</ul>
<p>o Two intro videos <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch" target="_blank">http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s</a></p>
<p>o We are using cjdns protocol for meshlocals in SF. cjdns=the software that runs on the nodes that are a part of hyperboria and/or meshnet. The batman protocol is being used in Oakland, sudoroom <strong><em>Thursdays</em></strong> to work on batman protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the meantime, if you just want to encrypt your communications, they are running cjdns over the internet. There’s an irc channel where you can get introduced to this. It’s called hyperboria. It is not ideal because it is not hardware to hardware but this is still a respectably secure way to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>o Both these methods make you a “node” which means it requires some processing power – but its not that bad. You can use hyperboria with your existing hardware.</p>
<p>o Currently only works with linux and mac, but they’re working on a windows version.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third, if you cannot run linux or figure out how to use irc… if that’s beyond you, we still will be looking for financial contributions and other ways to promote meshet, in the coming months, so you can sign up to support meshnet without being a user yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why meshnet? We might not have a choice, it may be too late to restore the fourth, and in the meantime. "Meet people where they are, at their level, try to get them to engage one level higher." - Alex</p>
<ul>
<li>Branding? Meshnet will be mentioned at cryptoparties. We will vote later on whether we support meshnet as an organization (preliminary vote seems positive) once they've looked into it further.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location, seems like powell is the most convenient, two people came by caltrain so being near caltrain isn't that important. Seemed like it was diffcult for a few people to get here.</li>
<li>Making a website (Daniel and Thawab, with some involvement from Ryan).</li>
<li>Michael as acting Regional Coordinator for 30 days and then we can reopen the issue. Ayes have it.</li>
<li>Alan update on national, gives an overview of how it started. There's an oversight committee, with local chapters represented with a low barrier to entry, event in last 90 days. Executives are elected. Mission of executive committee is being worked out. They want to buy restorethefourth.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>POST MEETING REVISIONS</p>
<p>Forgot to mention, Terms and Conditions May Apply, they're coming back to Oakland, August 20th at The New Parkway Theater <a href="http://www.thenewparkway.com/index.php?date=08%2F20%2F13" target="_blank">http://www.thenewparkway.com/index.php?date=08%2F20%2F13</a></p>
<p>Sudoroom Cryptoparty now moved to Aug 31</p>
