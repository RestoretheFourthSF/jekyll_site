</strong>The city council project aims to have city councils in the Bay Area pass primarily non-binding resolutions condemning the mass surveillance revealed by the Snowden leaks. The purpose of these resolutions is to provide public pressure from a local level to Congressional representatives whose districts include those cities. The work of this project is primarily in drafting the resolution, reaching out to partner organizations who may want to support the resolution, and working with city councils to pass the resolution.<!--more--></p>
<p>A success story on which we are partially modeling our efforts after is at Matthew Mahoney's <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/matthew-mahoney-nsa-metadata-spy-resolution/">one-man fight</a> to get localities in his area to pass the resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong><br />
1. We start by identifying cities, city council meeting times, sympathetic council members and so on. We coordinate using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApWG2DmCnC7EdFdHbzdnZGVzeF95QjI5bmhIek1ZTFE&amp;usp=sharing.">this spreadsheet</a>.<br />
<em></em></p>
<p><em>If your city is already on the spreadsheet:</em><br />
First, add your name to Column B of your city's column. You can use your first name only if you want, or even just put a +1 at the end of it if you're very sensitive about your name being on this spreadsheet. We will have more pull with city councils where we have more constituents. Then, fill in as many empty cells for your city as you can.</p>
<p><em>If your city is not already on the spreadsheet:</em><br />
Fill in the cells as best as you can.</p>
<p>2. Next, the resolution text has to be written. This process is at different stages depending on the locality. Some localities, such as San Francisco, demand more city-specific text. Simultaneously, we need to get other organizations involved and alert the relevant city council. To get involved in these efforts, email restorefoursf@gmail.com.</p>
<p><strong>Where we are now<br />
</strong>We have primarily concentrated our efforts on San Francisco, although other cities in the Bay Area are definitely on our radar. Anyone interested in spearheading an effort in their city would be welcome! The SF resolution text is being finalized, and we are in touch with a network of organizations and the SF Board of Supervisors regarding the resolution. In the coming weeks, we expect to send drafts to organizations for comment and with a request to sign on. Then, we will propose the resolution to the Board of Supervisors through a primary sponsor supervisor.</p>
