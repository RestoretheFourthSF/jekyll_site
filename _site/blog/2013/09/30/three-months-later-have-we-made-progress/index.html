<p dir="ltr"><strong>Rallies</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 26th March on DC by Stop Watching Us Coalition</span> this is coming up soon, you can RSVP on their <a href="https://rally.stopwatching.us" target="_blank">website </a>or on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/641805049185394/" target="_blank">Facebook </a>. Please email us at restorefoursf@gmail.com if you want help paying for a ticket, or if you want to financially support someone to attend the event, with  subject line “10/26 Actual Presence.” We’re hoping to organize something locally for those who cannot attend, we’ll let you know as soon as that’s decided.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Legislation (California)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SB 467</span> State Senator Mark Leno has put forward this bill which addresses email privacy. It restores the fourth amendment by requiring warrants to read emails. <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB467 " target="_blank">Here is the text of the bill</a>. It has been passed in the State Senate and Assembly and is sitting on Governor Brown’s desk to be signed, vetoed, or passively passed  into law. <a href="http://www.cold.ca.gov/agency_display.asp?ATRID=GVSOFC" target="_blank">Here is a list of phone numbers to reach him and ask him to sign the bill</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Right of Privacy Resolutions</span> are being prepared in San Francisco, Concord, and Palo Alto. <a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/san-francisco-board-of-supervisors-resolution-by-restore-the-fourth-sf-bay-area-and-coalition-members/" target="_blank"> San Francisco’s is providing the model</a>. We’re going to need you to call your supervisors/councilmembers and ask them to vote in favor of the resolutions once we have primary sponsors. Stay tuned.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Legislation (Federal)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NSA Reform Bill</span> (Wyden/Udall/Paul/Blumenthal) was announced next week but has not been introduced. Wyden summarizes it in <a href="http://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/intelligence-oversight-and-surveillance-reform-act" target="_blank">a pdf on his website</a>. When it’s been introduced in the senate, we will let you know, and you can start contacting your Senators to ask them to vote in favor of the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feinstein’s “Reform” Bill</span> as you know, Feinstein made quite a fool of herself in last week’s open hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. <a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/on-the-fisa-senate-intelligence-committee-hearing/" target="_blank">Read a brief summary here</a>. She’s now followed that up with a specious “reform” bill. Again, it is announced but not introduced, but we will let you know when you should start contacting your Senators to ask them to vote against the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Litigation</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jewel v. NSA</span> A hearing last Friday outlined the laborious process of bringing recent FOIA and Snowden releases into evidence for this old case. Read more here http://restorethefourthsf.com/jewel-v-nsa-case-management-hearing/.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. NSA</span> there’s a lot of overlap, some of the same lawyers and a lot of the same issues. So, on November 8th there will be a case management hearing which will decide to what extent this case should be combined with the Jewel case. Alice will attend and post a layman’s summary on the blog.</p>
