<p>On August 26, 2013 at 4pm, a group of organizations and individuals, including Restore the Fourth SF, representing the broad StopWatching.Us coalition met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's chief of staff in San Francisco, Dan Bernal.</p>
<p>Coalition representing StopWatching.Us</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracy Rosenberg, Media Alliance</li>
<li>Jennifer Granick, Stanford Law</li>
<li>Mark Jaycox, EFF</li>
<li>Anna Salem, ACLU</li>
<li>Matt Lockshin, Credo Action</li>
<li>Jonathan, Hackers and Founders</li>
<li>Nadia Kayyali, Bill of Rights Defense Committee</li>
<li>Michael Poon, Restore the Fourth SF<!--more--></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of 45 minutes, the coalition members covered the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want an end to Section 215 phone metadata collection, an end to Section 702 internet data collection, and transparency, including a release of secret court opinions.</li>
<li>We want a complete change, not tweaks. Specifically…</li>
<li>We want bulk collection to be stopped right now. That may take away some valuable capabilities/it may be a blunt thing, but it's gone so far wrong that it needs to stop right now — especially since we don't know the full scope of what's been going wrong. Specific capabilities can possibly be reinstated after, but bulk collection as it exists now must stop immediately.</li>
<li>Bulk collection and our principles/privacy/checks and balances are fundamentally at odds. The FISA Court doesn't work.</li>
<li>We need to hear a clear statement of principles from Pelosi on the matter that we can hold her to.</li>
<li>The solution to the surveillance overreach will likely come in several bills, since most likely, no one bill will nix all the concerns.</li>
<li>The surveillance hurts SF economics.</li>
<li>Pelosi needs to hold town halls and speak to constituents. Tele-town halls are okay.</li>
<li>Briefly: A mention of better whistleblower protections.</li>
<li>Briefly: The traditional FISA (before FISA Amendments Act of 2008) was actually better for privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we were there, I also delivered the public comments on the NSA scandal that we gathered at our August 4th event (pictured above).</p>
<p>Pelosi's office responded with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are a foreign policy office, not a legislative office, so they cannot comment on specifics.</li>
<li>Pelosi wants action in the fall. She will not wait for bill reauthorization (2015).</li>
<li>Pelosi/her office has not stonewalled us or anyone else on this issue.</li>
<li>Pelosi voted against the Amash Amendment because it was too blunt of an instrument. It was the wrong vehicle for change.</li>
<li>Standard fare: Pelosi has always had a strong position on privacy. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 did many good things for privacy. Et cetera.</li>
</ul>
<p>We, of course, were not able to extract any specific promises, but we clearly and strongly communicated what was necessary to fix this mess.</p>
<p>One coalition attendee, Tracy Rosenberg from Media Alliance, described it like this</p>
<blockquote><p>The quickest way to describe the 45-minute meeting is as a tug-of-war between two ideas:</p>
<p>a) blanket surveillance is fundamentally unconstitutional and needs to stop</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>b) NSA surveillance programs need to be tweaked to rein in some level of over-reach.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pelosi's office has agreed to meet with the coalition again when bills have moved further along the legislative cycle. They also gave us a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ik9zm4kzil0xnn2/FS60D_s_A4">summary of the public statements</a> Pelosi's made, including an open letter to Obama.</p>
