<li>We're trying to find shareholders who own $2000 in stock of the tech companies involved in the NSA"s PRISM program. Bear in mind, this probably only works for those that are traded publicly (Twitter, we're coming for you!)</li>
<li>Once you have a shareholder, you will want to look up the schedule for annual meetings on <a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml" target="_blank">Edgar</a>, the SEC's search engine for documents. The stock ticker is the easiest tool to look that up. Example shareholder proposals will be listed in the proxy statements filed for each annual meeting, as well. Here is <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312512515422/d450591dpre14a.htm" target="_blank">Apple Inc.'s 2013 proxy statement</a>.</li>
<li>Once you have the date that the last annual meeting was announced, add a year and count back 120 days to approximate the deadline for filing a shareholder proposal. The rules for where to send the proposal should be listed in the proxy statement as well.</li>
<li>Draft a letter from the shareholder and attach the proposal (500 words maximum). The shareholder or his designee must attend the annual meeting himself in order to get a vote on the proposal. So the letter may have to designate someone to attend the annual meeting in lieu of the shareholder.</li>
