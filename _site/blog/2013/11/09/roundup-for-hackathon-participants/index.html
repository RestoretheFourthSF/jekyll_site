We're the only dedicated privacy rights group in the Bay Area so we're bringing together organizations and projects on this issue. We're also drafting city council resolutions, shareholder proposals, status reports for the lawsuits, and bringing engineers and laypeople together to learn encryption techniques. Here's a summary of current projects you can help out with:<!--more--></p>
<p>- <a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/san-francisco-board-of-supervisors-resolution-by-restore-the-fourth-sf-bay-area-and-coalition-members/" target="_blank">Board of Supervisors resolution</a> in San Francisco, which has been drafted and has amassed a lot of significant supporters. We are going to begin looking for a primary sponsor soon, and we are considering who to approach and how to approach them at this stage.</p>
<p>- City council resolution in Concord - Kenji is working on this and we can put you in touch with him.</p>
<p>- Presentation at Apple's annual shareholder meeting in February: this is in early stages but David is working hard on this. <a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/new-shareholder-activism-project-first-target-named-apple-inc/" target="_blank">Here's a draft of the shareholder proposal </a>we're using as a model for the presentation.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/portfolio/prism-8-shareholder-activism/" target="_blank">Amazon and Google shareholder proposals</a>: We are hoping to submit shareholder proposals for Apple and Google's annual meetings next summer. We are looking for shareholders who own more than $2,000 in shares to attend the meeting to put forth the proposal. We'll do all the heavy lifting for you.</p>
<p>- The letter writing campaign project,<a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/ironing-board-democracy-letter-writing-campaign/" target="_blank"> read more here</a>.</p>
<p>- Cryptoparties are going to be organized by Eric and John. There's a mailing list, use the link "join us" at the top of the page to join it. We want to use non-tech venues and reach out to non-tech people, because we have found that there are a lot of different types of people who are interested in learning more.</p>
