    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Resolved:</p>
<p>A group of concerned Apple shareholders proposes several technical and policy actions Apple should take immediately, without waiting to be compelled by shareholders, to quickly earn back user trust and demonstrate Apple’s competence in repelling modern threats to user privacy.</p>
<p>We ask that the board enact a policy to use technical methods and other best practices to protect user data. Such best practices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption: Implement encryption techniques such as Forward Secrecy and the other recommended best practices cited in the Electronic Frontier Foundation's recent reports on encryption.</li>
<li>SSL Key Revocation: Revoke and update SSL encryption keys and any similar digital  entities that may have been compromised, immediately and as often as necessary for the security of user data.</li>
<li>Secure Network Equipment: Remove or replace any equipment that may be used for unconstitutional bulk surveillance at sites managed by Apple, to every legally permissible extent. Third-party equipment, such as interception devices installed in compliance with "pen trap and trace" orders, should provide access to confirm the devices can not be used for unconstitutional bulk collection or over-collection of data. If any court order or warrant must be withdrawn or revised to achieve this, Apple may seek relief from the courts – such as FISC courts that have already discovered systematic over-collection of data and ruled some programs unconstitutional – in the course of legally removing such equipment.</li>
<li>Transparency: Expand deployment of measures such as the “warrant canary” and “dead man switch” so users can be confident that Apple networks and encryption keys have not been compromised – or can be alerted if they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, as a U.S. company Apple has constitutional and ethical duties that include respecting the 4th Amendment.</p>
<p>Apple should, to the full extent permissible by law, deploy its strengths in both technology and law to publicly reveal, challenge, reduce, and overturn every government attempt at covert surveillance against its customers that doesn't meet these standards: surveillance of single, identified individuals under a warrant issued by a neutral judge, particularly describing the person and places to be searched, and of limited duration. To the full extent permissible by law, Apple should not actively or passively agree to do or allow covert mass surveillance against its customers, nor remain silent about what Apple and the government have done or are doing.</p>
<p>Lost trust will not be regained until Apple users and shareholders understand whether Apple is a paid participant in unconstitutional bulk surveillance, a hapless victim of it, a gagged hostage of government spies, badly in need of help – or, whether Apple is truly an effective foe of such surveillance.</p>
<p>For stewards of user data like Apple, both ethical standards and user trust are essential to sustaining shareholder value. Failing to acknowledge and address these realities can cause the company serious ongoing financial harm, particularly in international markets. Conversely, by addressing these issues forthrightly Apple can win back the trust of customers, provide leadership, offer competitive advantages, and strengthen the entire industry.</p>
