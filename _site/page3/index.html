            <p><p>Today, John McAfee announced a forthcoming hardware product called <a title="D-Central" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4786008/john-mcafee-d-central-device-avoid-nsa-private-network">D-Central </a>to provide consumers with private networking services that would be resistant to NSA scrutiny. He has described his product in only the highest level terms but we can infer a lot from his description and the fundamental architecture of the Internet.<!--more--></p>
<p><img class="img-frame alignright" alt="" src="assets/PirateBox_2-0_Case4.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>The D-Central seems to incorporate ideas similar to that of the <a title="MeshBox" href="https://fund.meshwith.me/">MeshBox</a> or the <a title="PirateBox" href="http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox_DIY">PirateBox</a>.  What all these initiatives have in common is they create a public environment where users can communicate privately without disclosing either content <em>or metadata</em> to the Internet providers. Most other encryption methods only prevent disclosure of  content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that D-Central, Meshbox and others can offer an accessible consumer product that can provide a mass surveillance resistant Internet experience to the masses. This is clearly possible: VPN providers, botnets, et cetera all operate darknets that have been highly resistant to compromise and surveillance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this kind of privacy-friendly Internet to truly succeed, it needs to provide both a developer platform and a business model. The centralized NSA friendly Internet developed because of the seductive appeal of easy applications development in data centers and the success of the advertising model. Without a developer platform, these experiments in Darknets are only going to be able to deliver a Web 1.0 experience of messaging and file sharing rather than compelling applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are potentially compelling aspects to an NSA-proof internet for developers. They would have to raise less capital for bandwidth and servers because costs would be distributed among their users. That's a business model, but is it enough to drive development?</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Rallies</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 26th March on DC by Stop Watching Us Coalition</span> this is coming up soon, you can RSVP on their <a href="https://rally.stopwatching.us" target="_blank">website </a>or on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/641805049185394/" target="_blank">Facebook </a>. Please email us at restorefoursf@gmail.com if you want help paying for a ticket, or if you want to financially support someone to attend the event, with  subject line “10/26 Actual Presence.” We’re hoping to organize something locally for those who cannot attend, we’ll let you know as soon as that’s decided.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Legislation (California)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SB 467</span> State Senator Mark Leno has put forward this bill which addresses email privacy. It restores the fourth amendment by requiring warrants to read emails. <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB467 " target="_blank">Here is the text of the bill</a>. It has been passed in the State Senate and Assembly and is sitting on Governor Brown’s desk to be signed, vetoed, or passively passed  into law. <a href="http://www.cold.ca.gov/agency_display.asp?ATRID=GVSOFC" target="_blank">Here is a list of phone numbers to reach him and ask him to sign the bill</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Right of Privacy Resolutions</span> are being prepared in San Francisco, Concord, and Palo Alto. <a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/san-francisco-board-of-supervisors-resolution-by-restore-the-fourth-sf-bay-area-and-coalition-members/" target="_blank"> San Francisco’s is providing the model</a>. We’re going to need you to call your supervisors/councilmembers and ask them to vote in favor of the resolutions once we have primary sponsors. Stay tuned.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Legislation (Federal)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NSA Reform Bill</span> (Wyden/Udall/Paul/Blumenthal) was announced next week but has not been introduced. Wyden summarizes it in <a href="http://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/intelligence-oversight-and-surveillance-reform-act" target="_blank">a pdf on his website</a>. When it’s been introduced in the senate, we will let you know, and you can start contacting your Senators to ask them to vote in favor of the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feinstein’s “Reform” Bill</span> as you know, Feinstein made quite a fool of herself in last week’s open hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. <a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/on-the-fisa-senate-intelligence-committee-hearing/" target="_blank">Read a brief summary here</a>. She’s now followed that up with a specious “reform” bill. Again, it is announced but not introduced, but we will let you know when you should start contacting your Senators to ask them to vote against the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Litigation</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jewel v. NSA</span> A hearing last Friday outlined the laborious process of bringing recent FOIA and Snowden releases into evidence for this old case. Read more here http://restorethefourthsf.com/jewel-v-nsa-case-management-hearing/.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. NSA</span> there’s a lot of overlap, some of the same lawyers and a lot of the same issues. So, on November 8th there will be a case management hearing which will decide to what extent this case should be combined with the Jewel case.

            <p><p>Thursday's Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing (<a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/FISALe">video here</a>; <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2013_hr/">transcripts here</a>) on the National Security Agency's surveillance programs and their (lack of) oversight and accountability was pretty vacuous.  Seeing as how the committee virtually ensured nothing was at stake during the hearing, it was dreadfully boring.  Having slogged through the entire video recording, I almost want to write committee chair (and one of my senators) Dianne Feinstein and request three hours of my life back.<!--more--></p>
<p>The vast majority of the <del>automatons</del> participants seemed to rotate between three modes of operation:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Bashing Edward Snowden and "the media" for exposure of the National Security Agency's activities</span></li>
<li>Emphasizing the legal and transparent nature of everything the NSA, FISC, etc. do</li>
<li>Praising the dedication, patriotism, intelligence, etc. of the United States' national security employees and the members of the committee</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking a page from the Condoleezza Rice book of fearmongering, the committee members stoked fear about the constant terrorist threats that the United States is purportedly facing.  DiFi opened up the hearing with a completely irrelevant news update about the recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westgate_shopping_mall_shooting">al-Shabaab attack in Kenya</a>.  Several other members, notably NSA Director Keith Alexander, repeatedly implied that disrupting the NSA's programs would result (or would have resulted) in terrorist attacks upon American soil.</p>
<p>Senators Mark Udall and Ron Wyden, the two on the intelligence committee who have been mildly critical of the NSA, were the lone exceptions to the hours-long monotony.  They at least asked some questions that could not be characterized as softballs, but were really unable to pursue a line of questioning given the five-minute limit that DiFi placed on each senator's question and answer session with the panelists (Alexander, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Deputy Attorney General James Cole).</p>
<p>The hearing finished up with statements from two NSA supporters, Ben Wittes and Tim Edgar.  Their sycophantic performances ensured the hearing could conclude without any interesting information filtering through to the public.</p>
<p>Several senators in their non-questions to Alexander and Clapper seemed to have a less than adequate grasp of the hearing's subject matter.  Marcy Wheeler comments that these senators "filibustered themselves so they wouldn’t have to ask any questions (and therefore betray ignorance)."</p>
<p>DiFi again should win the award for most supercilious defense of a secretive government national security program.  Opening the hearing with the statement that "The public has a misperception and that must be corrected," she gaslighted throughout the hearing, uttering such ridiculous assertions as "Much of the press has called this a surveillance program.  It is not."</p>
<p>It is very hard to escape the conclusion that Glenn Greenwald came to after watching the hearing: "The very idea that meaningful reform of the NSA will come out of this annexed, captured, corrupted Committee is ludicrous on its face."</p>

            <h2 class="title"><a href="/blog/featured/2013/09/28/jewel-v-nsa-case-management-hearing/" rel="prefetch">Jewel v. NSA Case Management Hearing</a></h2>
            <p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jewel v. NSA</span> is one of several cases against unconstitutional surveillance in the courts. This one is FIVE years old - in fact, it was originally founded on the facts revealed by Mark Klein, who spoke at our rally on 1984 Day. For background and further documents, please visit <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel" target="_blank">the Electronic Frontier Foundation website</a>. Today, we heard a very interesting ruling from the judge in the case, that fundamentally benefits the plaintiffs (all US citizens and all AT&amp;T customers, each represented by a lead plaintiff). But, it's procedurally and strategically complex, so it bears some explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: A whole lot of evidence that was declassified or otherwise made public can now be used to establish standing in the case.<!--more--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why does that matter?</strong> The courts require evidence that the plaintiff has been a victim of illegal surveillance for the case to move forward - this is "standing". The government has cunningly classified the targets of surveillance so that the victims cannot present their evidence to the court. The Snowden releases and FOIA releases have lead to a massive declassification of evidence necessary to show that every American has the right to sue. To cite the releases for the purposes of arguing standing, they must be in the record. The case, however, is premised on old filings and the admissibility of classified evidence has already been addressed - so, we have to ask the judge to include the new information in the record. Fortunately the judge reopened that can of worms, and ordered the government to revise the classified/withheld evidence and add evidence  that was declassified to the record, giving the plaintiffs the ability to base their arguments on the releases. <em>The judge wants to see facts distinguishing this case from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clapper v. Amnesty International</span>, and has handed access to those facts to the plaintiffs on a platter</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will describe the hearing in detail, and correct me if you think that was not what he did!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The judge issued a ruling today based on many briefs filed on "threshold" issues. Threshold issues are things like standing, preemption, access to classified evidence, etc - before the government explains why it is not in violation of the Fourth Amendment. So far the government has not written their answer to the complaint - they have merely raised the threshold issues. <em>We were hoping that today, the judge would dispose of the threshold issues and set a schedule for discovery</em>. That didn't happen, but as I said earlier, it's for the best. If the judge had ruled that the plaintiffs had standing, that would have been appealed (technical term: "interlocutory appeal"), further delaying the case. And the plaintiffs still wouldn't have anything stronger than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clapper v. Amnesty International</span>, who didn't have standing according to the Supreme Court. So back to square one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The judge laid out four more threshold issues, with arguments to be submitted:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. If FISA overrides the state secrets doctrine for the statutory claims under FISA (an act of congress), does it also override it for constitutional claims? To be submitted by the government by <strong>Dec 20</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a fairly complicated issue, but suffice to say, the state secret doctrine does NOT benefit us. It allows the government to hide more evidence. So far, the judge has only ruled that FISA overrides it for statutory claims. But we care about the constitutional claims (violations of the Fourth Amendment) far more. The government does not want FISA to override the state secrets doctrine, so that's what they will be arguing.</p>
<blockquote><p>2. Do the FISA procedural mechanisms also apply for the constitutional claims? To be submitted by the government by <strong>Dec 20</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I dunno what this is about, or what affect it has. Seems unimportant.</p>
<blockquote><p>3. If FISA overrides both statutory claims and constitutional claims, and the FISA procedural mechanisms apply to both: <em>Show that the plaintiffs have standing without damage to national security, with reference to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clapper v. Amnesty International</span> footnote 4.</em> To be submitted by the plaintiffs by <strong>Jan 31</strong>.<em><br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is the "meat and potatoes" so to speak. See above - we need to show that the harm is not speculative or future-oriented, but that it has already occurred.</p>
<blockquote><p>4. After the record has been corrected to reflect declassified documents, the government must show the actual impact of the purported risks to national security. To be briefed by the government by <strong>Dec 20</strong>.<em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Two additional crucial points made by the judge:</p>
<ul>
<li>The government must revise/put into evidence the declassified documents by<strong> Dec 20</strong> - that means they have to comb through all evidence ever withheld from 2007, 2009 and 2012. And the judge anticipates in advance that the plaintiffs will insist more documents were declassified and that the government missed stuff, and plans that they can raise those objections on <strong>Jan 10</strong>.</li>
<li>The judge anticipates that there may be further FOIA releases and therefore the plaintiffs may ask for a further delay to add the evidence if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the deck is stacked in favor of the plaintiffs here. They have one issue to argue, and they already know what's declassified/citable, so they have a lot more time to write it. However, each party has to write a response, and then a further reply, to each issue. The final filings are due <strong>Feb 28</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all goes well, we can expect a ruling by spring 2014. That means the government's answer, and discovery, and all the other juicy stuff won't come until next summer. But at least the argument for standing is extremely strong now. We must get past threshhold issues to get anywhere in the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And at the end of the day</strong> Fourth Amendment protections of electronic data, metadata, and a host of other private things haven't been awarded by the Supreme Court. Our greatest hope is in a Supreme Court ruling  that embraces the full reality of the NSA's activities, and the full reality of electronic data as it stands today. These court cases are essential. They are slow, frustrating, and may appear irrelevant. But one perspective is that it's the crowded on-ramp to the superhighway of freedom.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you all tomorrow!</p>

            <p><p>This is the draft being submitted to the BORDC, the EFF, and potential primary sponsors. Title: <strong>Resolution for the Conclusion and Investigation of Mass Surveillance</strong></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>[Protecting the constitutional rights of residents and calling for a congressional investigation into mass surveillance activities.]</p>
<p>Resolution supporting the right to privacy, reminding agencies of the City and County of San Francisco that they are not permitted to conduct or assist in mass surveillance of private communications, urging law enforcement to respect the right to privacy, and requesting our United States Senators and members of Congress to both investigate past violations and prevent future violations of the Fourth and First Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Privacy is a fundamental right reflected in the Constitution of the State of California Article 1 Section 1 and is further protected by the Fourth Amendment and other state and federal law; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, The right to privacy confers dignity and security to residents of the City and County of San Francisco, as well as protects the presumption of innocence underlying due process and their fundamental right to free speech, free association, and a free press; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, The Board of Supervisors passed Resolution 53-03 in 2003 instructing officials not to comply with the PATRIOT Act insofar as it allows violations of the rights of United States citizens; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, In 2006, Mark Klein exposed the National Security Agency’s mass interception of telecommunications at the AT&amp;T building on 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, FISA Court decisions have revealed that federal agencies have in fact unconstitutionally violated the privacy of United States citizens by harvesting domestic communications, and the NSA has admitted to allowing analysts to use databases for personal use, and storing of all communication metadata, indicating a policy and culture of disregard of privacy rights within federal agencies; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Federal agencies have incentivized cities to use surveillance against their residents, including in the City of Oakland which accepted federal funds for the Domain Awareness Center, and the City and County of San Francisco should not accept additional federal funds for unconstitutional surveillance projects; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, The City and County of San Francisco is a city of refuge for many individuals that suffer persecution, including by reason of religion, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, sexuality and gender identity, economic status, mental illness, and homelessness; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Systemic violations of privacy have a chilling effect on free speech and freedom of association which protects and advances humanity, and systematic violations of privacy erode the presumption of innocence required by due process, now therefore, be it</p>
<p>RESOLVED, That the residents of San Francisco strongly affirm our commitment to the rights and liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the State of California, and the United States Constitution, including the Fourth and First Amendments; and</p>
<p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we ask federal and state law enforcement working within the City and County of San Francisco to work in accordance with local law including the right to privacy, free speech and freedom of association provided by the Constitution of the State of California and the United States Constitution; and</p>
<p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED That the residents of San Francisco ask our United States Senators and members of Congress to launch a full independent congressional investigation into the intelligence community’s unconstitutional mass surveillance and hold individuals and agencies accountable for violations of the Fourth and First Amendments, and to restore fundamental rights and liberties embodied in the Constitution of the State of California and the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>The Board of Supervisors shall immediately send copies of this resolution to our United States Senators and members of Congress, the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the United States Attorney General, and the President of the United States.</p></blockquote>

            <p><p>If you want to get involved with the political side of the blanket surveillance issue, here's an opportunity for you!  I (Kenji) am looking for volunteers to join me in staffing an ironing board at an intersection with lots of foot traffic in Vallejo, Benicia, or Santa Rosa. The first location will probably be the <a href="http://www.pcfma.com/market_home.php?market_id=19" target="_blank">Vallejo Farmers' Market</a> (9am-1pm Saturdays).<!--more--></p>
<p>The goal of this ironing board station:  to invite passers-by to write actual pen-and-paper letters to Representative Mike Thompson, asking him to stand up for the Fourth Amendment in the future instead of defending the NSA's surveillance programs as he has done so far.</p>
<p>I'll bring the materials:  the ironing board, envelopes, paper, pens, stamps, mailing addresses of Rep. Thompson and other Bay Area members of Congress, at least one sample letter text for people to copy or adapt, and a stack of flyers explaining the blanket surveillance issue and who we are.</p>
<p>Please bring yourself, a readiness to be friendly and outgoing to our fellow citizens in the 5th Congressional District, and maybe some catchy lines to attract people to our station.  If you have a smartphone, that would be helpful for looking up addresses of any other officials whom people want to write letters to.  (My phone is of the dumb variety.)</p>
<p>I can provide a ride from and to anywhere in the East Bay, including Contra Costa County.  If interested, please leave a comment at the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourthSF/comments/1krrax/ironing_board_democracy_plan/" target="_blank">reddit page for this project.  More details are available there. </a>Let me know how to contact you and when you're available.  I welcome suggestions.</p>

            <p><p><img class="img-frame aligncenter" alt="" src="assets/1116226_10200863643007633_1209147119_o.jpg" /></p>
<p>On August 26, 2013 at 4pm, a group of organizations and individuals, including Restore the Fourth SF, representing the broad StopWatching.Us coalition met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's chief of staff in San Francisco, Dan Bernal.</p>
<p>Coalition representing StopWatching.Us</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracy Rosenberg, Media Alliance</li>
<li>Jennifer Granick, Stanford Law</li>
<li>Mark Jaycox, EFF</li>
<li>Anna Salem, ACLU</li>
<li>Matt Lockshin, Credo Action</li>
<li>Jonathan, Hackers and Founders</li>
<li>Nadia Kayyali, Bill of Rights Defense Committee</li>
<li>Michael Poon, Restore the Fourth SF<!--more--></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of 45 minutes, the coalition members covered the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want an end to Section 215 phone metadata collection, an end to Section 702 internet data collection, and transparency, including a release of secret court opinions.</li>
<li>We want a complete change, not tweaks. Specifically…</li>
<li>We want bulk collection to be stopped right now. That may take away some valuable capabilities/it may be a blunt thing, but it's gone so far wrong that it needs to stop right now — especially since we don't know the full scope of what's been going wrong. Specific capabilities can possibly be reinstated after, but bulk collection as it exists now must stop immediately.</li>
<li>Bulk collection and our principles/privacy/checks and balances are fundamentally at odds. The FISA Court doesn't work.</li>
<li>We need to hear a clear statement of principles from Pelosi on the matter that we can hold her to.</li>
<li>The solution to the surveillance overreach will likely come in several bills, since most likely, no one bill will nix all the concerns.</li>
<li>The surveillance hurts SF economics.</li>
<li>Pelosi needs to hold town halls and speak to constituents. Tele-town halls are okay.</li>
<li>Briefly: A mention of better whistleblower protections.</li>
<li>Briefly: The traditional FISA (before FISA Amendments Act of 2008) was actually better for privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we were there, I also delivered the public comments on the NSA scandal that we gathered at our August 4th event (pictured above).</p>
<p>Pelosi's office responded with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are a foreign policy office, not a legislative office, so they cannot comment on specifics.</li>
<li>Pelosi wants action in the fall. She will not wait for bill reauthorization (2015).</li>
<li>Pelosi/her office has not stonewalled us or anyone else on this issue.</li>
<li>Pelosi voted against the Amash Amendment because it was too blunt of an instrument. It was the wrong vehicle for change.</li>
<li>Standard fare: Pelosi has always had a strong position on privacy. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 did many good things for privacy. Et cetera.</li>
</ul>
<p>We, of course, were not able to extract any specific promises, but we clearly and strongly communicated what was necessary to fix this mess.</p>
<p>One coalition attendee, Tracy Rosenberg from Media Alliance, described it like this</p>
<blockquote><p>The quickest way to describe the 45-minute meeting is as a tug-of-war between two ideas:</p>
<p>a) blanket surveillance is fundamentally unconstitutional and needs to stop</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>b) NSA surveillance programs need to be tweaked to rein in some level of over-reach.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pelosi's office has agreed to meet with the coalition again when bills have moved further along the legislative cycle. They also gave us a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ik9zm4kzil0xnn2/FS60D_s_A4">summary of the public statements</a> Pelosi's made, including an open letter to Obama.</p>
