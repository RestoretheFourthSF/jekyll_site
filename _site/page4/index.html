            <p><p><strong>Background<br />
</strong>The city council project aims to have city councils in the Bay Area pass primarily non-binding resolutions condemning the mass surveillance revealed by the Snowden leaks. The purpose of these resolutions is to provide public pressure from a local level to Congressional representatives whose districts include those cities. The work of this project is primarily in drafting the resolution, reaching out to partner organizations who may want to support the resolution, and working with city councils to pass the resolution.<!--more--></p>
<p>A success story on which we are partially modeling our efforts after is at Matthew Mahoney's <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/matthew-mahoney-nsa-metadata-spy-resolution/">one-man fight</a> to get localities in his area to pass the resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong><br />
1. We start by identifying cities, city council meeting times, sympathetic council members and so on. We coordinate using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApWG2DmCnC7EdFdHbzdnZGVzeF95QjI5bmhIek1ZTFE&amp;usp=sharing.">this spreadsheet</a>.<br />
<em></em></p>
<p><em>If your city is already on the spreadsheet:</em><br />
First, add your name to Column B of your city's column. You can use your first name only if you want, or even just put a +1 at the end of it if you're very sensitive about your name being on this spreadsheet. We will have more pull with city councils where we have more constituents. Then, fill in as many empty cells for your city as you can.</p>
<p><em>If your city is not already on the spreadsheet:</em><br />
Fill in the cells as best as you can.</p>
<p>2. Next, the resolution text has to be written. This process is at different stages depending on the locality. Some localities, such as San Francisco, demand more city-specific text. Simultaneously, we need to get other organizations involved and alert the relevant city council. To get involved in these efforts, email restorefoursf@gmail.com.</p>
<p><strong>Where we are now<br />
</strong>We have primarily concentrated our efforts on San Francisco, although other cities in the Bay Area are definitely on our radar. Anyone interested in spearheading an effort in their city would be welcome! The SF resolution text is being finalized, and we are in touch with a network of organizations and the SF Board of Supervisors regarding the resolution. In the coming weeks, we expect to send drafts to organizations for comment and with a request to sign on. Then, we will propose the resolution to the Board of Supervisors through a primary sponsor supervisor.</p>
<p><b>Follow up</b><br />
For any questions or to get involved, email restorefoursf@gmail.com!</p>

            <p><p>Here is a summary of some of the discussion at the EFF! Quotes are unattributed, sorry. <a href="https://wiki.openitp.org/doku.php?id=events%3Atechno-activism_3rd_mondays">https://wiki.openitp.org/doku.php?id=events%3Atechno-activism_3rd_mondays</a></p>
<p><strong>Threat Levels</strong></p>
<p>We should distinguish between different threat levels because they require different levels of encryption security. We also have to be aware that the threat level only increases if your content is "worthwhile enough" so a way to avoid needing further encryption protection would be to avoid being noticed as worthwhile. The key to that is to hide metadata.</p>
<p>The threat level concept eventually breaks down, however, because in order to communicate outside the secure group, you are immediately downgraded to "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">lowest common denominator</span>" encryption techniques.<!--more--></p>
<p>One goal could be to resist the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chilling effect</span> of NSA surveillance. Encryption should be universally used, and always end to end, to prevent First Amendment issues.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, the NSA always prefers passive attacks over active ones. Passive attaches are cheaper, less noticeable. End to end encryption is the way to protect from passive attacks. It might not protect against active attacks (targetting). SO we can FORCE the NSA to do active attacks, explicitly targeting a defined threat, by using encryption - trap them into fishing with a rod instead of a net.</p>
<p>HTTPS is a part of end to end encryption and relying on it would kill some NSA data collection programs alone.</p>
<p>Back to threat models, though - everyone is working with a different one. If by some unfortunate circumstance you are being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACTIVELY targeted</span> by the NSA, you just have to throw away all of your computers. And some people have done that. For us, that's not necessary.</p>
<p>If your threat model is "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ability to publis</span>h" and issues of censorship, let's say in a country like Iran or Syria, it's easier to protect you. The EFF software designers have a customer base of publishers in oppressive regimes. But we have to understand what the threats are, what techniques of surveillance and attack are being used, before we know what software we need to build. The EFF is 2-3 months away from producing this solution.</p>
<p>Generally reduce your footprint to protect yourself as well, less data needs to be encrypted if less of it is available. Don't necessarily throw away all your computers, but find a way to limit how much personal data is transmitted through them.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Government Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>How are foreign governments acquiring surveillance technologies? They're basically buying them off the shelf. They have no internal talent, it's basically an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arms trade</span>. Currently it's so crude that the target can actually see what they are doing. They're buying DDOS botnets for example, to target individual journalists, or hiring freelance hackers to create malware.</p>
<p>The surveillance systems that are for sale will become more and more sophisticated and harder to detect. And internationally there is almost no structural protection against this tool. We're actually a LOT safer in the US because we even have these privacy laws in the first place.</p>
<p>These <span style="text-decoration: underline;">off-the-shelf surveillance products</span> are a justification for the NSA activity. The US government's optimal position is to make sure no foreign governments can surveil their citizenry, but that they have full access. Therefore, their technology must be infinitely superior to whats available elswhere. They need an assymetry betwen what the US can do and what our enemies can do. That's the justification. Only the US government can invade the privacy of US citizens, esentially.</p>
<p>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data at rest</span>" questions - once the data is stored on a server that's a security issue too. Passive data collection requires data on the move. But data at rest is much more protected in the US than elsewhere. That's why PRISM ignited fear globally.</p>
<p>How do the laws work in other countries? Caroline uses <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GCHQ</span> in Britain as an example. They claim the right to access any data that travels through underseas cables under "RIPA" law. It's irrelevant who sent or received it, even if it's an entirely domestic communication it might still bounce to these underseas cables.  That's less protection than in the US, at least FISA appears to require one end be outside the US, and even US citizens outside the US have some protections.</p>
<p><strong>Using v. Collecting</strong></p>
<p>One question is, how are they using this data? Isn't that what we're really worried about? Even the collection of the data is unconstitutional, none of the constraints that the fourth amendment is interpreted to provide apply to collection at all. Restore the Fourth's resolution, for example, is solely about collection - it's also very hard to prove that the data is being used. Efficiency suggests that the use is in fact limited to targets in some way. But there are no good examples yet - it would expose NSA's capabilities if they admitted where they got the  evidence. So for example the DEA will construct <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a second chain of evidence</span> afterwards.</p>
<p>Use in a civil subpoena context? The ECPA prevents private companies from giving out more than just the basic IP address type information. Also, they might not provide the data because it's a hassle.</p>
<p><strong>An Aside</strong>: Look into the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy" target="_blank"> forward security protection </a>technique. This involves using different keys for every communication and then destroying them after the communication has been read. Like a digital "'burn after reading."</p>

<div>
<p>Bob asked me to share his writeup of the cell phone class:</p>
<p>I sat in on the android phone security break out group. To keep it simple, I'll just say a little bit about the apps for secure text and voice. They are both pretty easy to install and use.<!--more--></p>
<p>For text messages go to the App Store and download Text Secure, setup is easy, follow the prompts. Once you have exchanged a key with someone also using it, every text you send them will be encrypted. Easiest way to verify each other is in person of course, it basically sends each person a hash tag, you can do this remotely but always easier and better to do when you are together. Using this app basically overrides your standard text client, any text you send will look for the recipient also using it. If they aren't , no biggie. It then is just a standard text. Once set up, it is completely transparent to the user.</p>
<p>Encrypted voice calls:</p>
<p>Download the Red Phone app, simple to set up, again follow the prompts This works a little differently in use, it generates a one time key between the parties based on a 2 word pass phrase. Basically if you call someone also using red phone, you will each see a pass phrase, just say the phrase at the beginning of the call and then you are encrypted Again, pretty easy to use... Oh, one of the devs was there and I asked him about VoIP and yes, this works on that too. So if you use google voice or Skype, your voice calls will still be encrypted .</p>
<p>Both of these apps are from whisper net and free to use.</p>
<p>Oh, we did talk a bit about encrypting all of your phones data as well. Go to settings/security/encrypt device, follow the prompts. Encrypting all of your phones data will take some time, be sure you are plugged in to your charger</p>
<p>Also discussed password security for your phone, it's kind of a balance there... Sure, a 40 character password is more secure but who wants to type that in every time you want to unlock your phone You should have one but its up to you how hard you want to make it for yourself</p>

<p>PGP Encryption taught by Will.</p>
<p>Download <strong>GPG, Mozilla Thunderbird, and a plugin called Enigmail</strong>. PGP encryption was used by Glenn Greenwald and Snowden. It works with a pair of keys, a private and a public key.</p>
<p>Encryption is done by sequences of numbers, and you and your recipient have to share the same “cypher” for that. Simplest is Rot13, shift all the letters 13 spaces. And then you can change each letter by different increments, which creates much higher level of security. Then there's “Asymmetric encryption” - this is our method, it uses two keys, private and public. <strong>Someone can write you an email that’s encrypted by public key and can only be decrypted with your private key.</strong> If you send an email to four people, it will be encrypted four times using their public keys.<!--more--></p>
<p>Here are the essential instructions:</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the two applications and the plugin, you will go to the Thunderbird menu, find OpenPGP and select “Key Management” and generate a key with a very secure passcode/password. (There’s a dialogue box regarding revocation certificates, you can do that or wait til later). You will right click on the key in the Key Management window, and upload it to all the listed servers. Then once you exchange keys with another person, when you create an email, you can select encrypt by clicking on the key on the bottom right hand corner.</p>
<p>Additional security measures:</p>
<p>The number one way to circumvent this form of encryption is to create a third party intermediary between you and the other person ("man in the middle"). First they replace your public key with their public key and then decrypt it, then recrypt it using your correct public key and send it to the true recipient. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want your public key to be on many sites/in many places so that it can’t be replaced by someone else’s public key to get access to the communications. Use https websites.</li>
<li>You want to right click on a user’s key and select key properties, and read out the “<strong>fingerprint</strong>” (a summary of the key) in person to verify that you have the correct public key. If one byte is changed in the public key, it gives a different fingerprint.</li>
<li>What happens when private keys are compromised? “key revocation certificate” creates a centralized way to inform people not to use the public key.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use encryption to sign the email and even a recipient who does not have your public key will know it’s sent by you. That’s a separate feature.</p>
<p>Multiple keys, and transitioning to new keys: You should begin to transition to new keys in advance, and use it to sign emails that are encrypted using the old key. Then, when you revoke the old key, people know that the new key is from the same person.</p>

<p><strong>Big Data</strong> talk, we no longer need to process data before storing it because the storage is so cheap, that’s a sea change – just store it all and figure it out later when the technology to process it is available. Loading and unloading can be the most limiting factor/it’s a bottleneck. SO you want that storage to be the analytic platform reducing loading and unloading. Microsegmentation becomes possible. Predictive analytics and machine learning is the new way to find insider trading because they're always ahead of regulators, they'll use it at the NSA too. Data is never thrown away so they can always rerun the algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>DAC</strong> in Oakland, an organization hosted a walking tour. Economic reasons drove these decisions, we always should ask what is the economic result? Target is poor people and people of color, how does it impact those populations. More than just cameras - digital data as well, overlay maps with people watching the feeds.

<p><strong>East Bay Mesh</strong> (presented by Sudo Room’s Jenny &amp; colleague). Big local network of wifis talking together. Community owned infrastructure.

Creating the 501(c)(3). Looking for volunteers, doing classes and workshops, you can help out on Thursday nights. Network is separate from the nonprofit, they’re helping support nodes, and then peering agreements for self-supported ones. Raised money for first 100 nodes (routers and antennas). Meshmap.sudoroom.org to map antennas. IRC: Freenode #510pen. How do we connect Oakland and SF? Internet connection to SF using dark fiber, they are talking to Internet Archive about doing this.</p>
<p><strong>Security Activism</strong> from Danny O’Brien, example is the cryptoparty earlier in the day. Security activism is what allows other forms of activism to exist - they all rely on privacy. Digital security politics: the history. They know everything and you know nothing. Digital security is personal, technological and political. They’re all interrelated. Danny is the international director. They’re using their experience from copyright to chart the progress of the surveillance debate. What can we do, hit above our weight, coalitions. Technological solutions. Personal feedback loops to show you have succeeded helped with copyright, and there’s no feedback from combatting surveillance. There are no visuals either. And the NSA is much worse as an enemy than the RIAA. We’re fighting for other people, so encryption isn’t helping them. NSA's secrecy might be their downfall, we have the advantage of openness. Private ownership of data is important.</p>

            <p><p>22 people present. Michael moderating.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>August 4th Review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positives: speakers, Sina, Sam and EFF gets the credit. Videos, good sound system, whistles, sign table, positive relations with the police, anarchists were dissuaded.</li>
<li>older attendees - this issue came up in the 60s, great we got older people.</li>
<li>Lots of attendees ~400 - but we want more people.</li>
<li>traditional political activists do not feel there's a strong connection to this issue. new activists came, who were able to relate to it. not life and death. show them scenarios why it matters - blackmail (expressed in the negative: spying is ok as long as you've never done anything wrong, you never will do anything wrong, and you love no-one). Cannibal cop in NY, actual abuse. UK politician, FBI agent book. Lots of details here. Value of rule of law to create a viceral response.</li>
<li>Lots of messages to be promoted at future events. Ads, media marketing. Make our message more concrete for bay area residents. Oakland, anarchist message. More flyers posted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outreach/Coalition Building</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tea Party Kenji (East Bay) Ryan (South Bay).</li>
<li>Bitcoin (Casey)</li>
<li>Personal Cloud (Alex) with interest from Eric and Daniel.</li>
<li>Junior State of America covering northern California (Nick and Michael)</li>
<li>Senior Center (Kyle and Kenji)</li>
<li><strong><em>August 18th</em></strong> 99% Coalition event, rsvp at sf99percent at gmail. <strong><em>August 31st</em></strong> sudoroom cryptoparty/EFF presentations.</li>
<li><strong><em>Labor Day</em></strong> Occupy SF group, thread on reddit, Facebook thread (Alice will post those)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current projects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Email restorefourSF at gmail to get involved in specific Town Halls or contact Michael. Non-confrontational, relationship building and relationships that constitute influence closer to votes. [Side discussion on civil disobedience, contempt of court in tech companies].</li>
<li>Town Hall Santa Rosa, <strong><em>Aug 21</em></strong> 3:30 pm Zaki is in charge. Thompson voted against Amash Amendment, involved with relevant committee. Of local representatives, he's the one we've been most successful at reaching out to. Meeting with senior staff person, doing prep for it over the next day or so.</li>
<li>Recitation videos, some laypeople made theirs. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/RestoreTheFourthsf" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/user/RestoreTheFourthsf</a> Should we expand our questions? After all, congress claims everything is legal. So we should ask them to define what's legal and not illegal, gets deeper into the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future Projects</strong></p>
<p>Encryption options</p>
<ul>
<li>"Silent Circle" <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/the-truth-about-why-silent-circle-silenced-their-secure-email-service-7000019300/" target="_blank">http://www.zdnet.com/the-truth-about-why-silent-circle-silenced-their-secure-email-service-7000019300/</a></li>
<li>Bit levels of encryption, alice to check with EFF to see if there is still an illegal level of encryption.</li>
<li>Crypto party every 4th of every month, nationally, so that keys can't be traced to specific geographic areas.</li>
<li>Eric is organizing/administrating the cryptoparty. Expanding the mailing list. Whitepaper from Freedom of the Press foundation <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/06/encryption-works-how-protect-your-privacy-age-nsa-surveillance" target="_blank">https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/06/encryption-works-how-protect-your-privacy-age-nsa-surveillance</a> How do we reach out to laypeople: new name? Encryption Workshop. Typically very introductory. People bring their laptops. PGP, Redphone, encrypted text messages and phone calls.</li>
<li>Existing cryptoparties, we should collaborate with other groups. "Cryptoparty SF" - <a href="http://cryptopartysf.org/" target="_blank">http://cryptopartysf.org/</a>.</li>
<li>Wes's honeypot project: Identified situations where access to data is abused. 611 Folsom is still filtering data, what about trying to get flagged, we can see if they try to access it on our server. Human rights activists are monitored, opportunity to reach out based on this. License plate readers, FOIA request for cars used by gov officials, and then use the videos to track. Existing private network of videos can be used to track the cars. Honey pots? It's hard to detect passive surveillance (tor was obvious) but detecting active attacks is easier. But active attacks prove passive surveillance. Isn't this counterproductive - not exactly an abuse to pursue a potential terrorist. Do we want to prove something that was already proven?</li>
</ul>
<p>We are forming a working group for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weakness of abusers is they have to recruit intelligent people, nsa recruiting tactics. Computer science professors are asking their students not to work there.</li>
<li>Getting city councils to sign a nonbinding resolution. It's easy for them to do it, raises visibility in local areas and reaches out to normal people. Recitation videos too. Alice and Michael are going to do SF. Combining this with town hall groups. Combining this with town hall groups. Blueprint needs to be created. Get a list of city councils and their history, focus on districts with reps who voted in favor of the Amash Amendment. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/</a> Data here <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing</a></li>
<li>Bob, street theater as fun outreach to individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Meshnet</strong></p>
<p>Our meshnet person couldn’t be here, Alice is giving a vague overview. PM if you want to get in touch with him for <strong><em>thursdays at noisebridge</em></strong>. PM for IRC.</p>
<p>There are different levels of interest and involvement, I know some are put off by the high tech stuff, so I’ll separate it into three parts and then do questions. First, an overview all a meshnet does is encrypt between computers - no endpoint encryption/protection. Since everything is displayed on/typed into a computer without encryption, this depends on your computer itself being secure – we know windows has a keylogger for example. Three levels of interest are hardware-to-hardware meshnet (long term goal), internet based (hyberboria), and then layperson.</p>
<ul>
<li>First; the ideal is hardware-to-hardware. Our project meshnet contact needs people who can contribute hardware and who understand hardware. His current transmitter is .5 miles and he lives near filmore and geary. If you want to set up your own meshlocal, you can talk to him. He has outlined several other hardware-to-hardware options…</li>
</ul>
<p>o Two intro videos <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch" target="_blank">http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/hacktivists-want-to-free-the-net-by-building-a-new-one-from-scratch</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=5m20s</a></p>
<p>o We are using cjdns protocol for meshlocals in SF. cjdns=the software that runs on the nodes that are a part of hyperboria and/or meshnet. The batman protocol is being used in Oakland, sudoroom <strong><em>Thursdays</em></strong> to work on batman protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the meantime, if you just want to encrypt your communications, they are running cjdns over the internet. There’s an irc channel where you can get introduced to this. It’s called hyperboria. It is not ideal because it is not hardware to hardware but this is still a respectably secure way to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>o Both these methods make you a “node” which means it requires some processing power – but its not that bad. You can use hyperboria with your existing hardware.</p>
<p>o Currently only works with linux and mac, but they’re working on a windows version.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third, if you cannot run linux or figure out how to use irc… if that’s beyond you, we still will be looking for financial contributions and other ways to promote meshet, in the coming months, so you can sign up to support meshnet without being a user yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why meshnet? We might not have a choice, it may be too late to restore the fourth, and in the meantime. "Meet people where they are, at their level, try to get them to engage one level higher." - Alex</p>
<ul>
<li>Branding? Meshnet will be mentioned at cryptoparties. We will vote later on whether we support meshnet as an organization (preliminary vote seems positive) once they've looked into it further.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location, seems like powell is the most convenient, two people came by caltrain so being near caltrain isn't that important. Seemed like it was diffcult for a few people to get here.</li>
<li>Making a website (Daniel and Thawab, with some involvement from Ryan).</li>
<li>Michael as acting Regional Coordinator for 30 days and then we can reopen the issue. Ayes have it.</li>
<li>Alan update on national, gives an overview of how it started. There's an oversight committee, with local chapters represented with a low barrier to entry, event in last 90 days. Executives are elected. Mission of executive committee is being worked out. They want to buy restorethefourth.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>POST MEETING REVISIONS</p>
<p>Forgot to mention, Terms and Conditions May Apply, they're coming back to Oakland, August 20th at The New Parkway Theater <a href="http://www.thenewparkway.com/index.php?date=08%2F20%2F13" target="_blank">http://www.thenewparkway.com/index.php?date=08%2F20%2F13</a></p>
<p>Sudoroom Cryptoparty now moved to Aug 31</p>
<p>Several people expressed interest in the personal cloud meeting: <a href="http://personal-clouds.org/wiki/Personal_Clouds:Current_events" target="_blank">http://personal-clouds.org/wiki/Personal_Clouds:Current_events</a></p>
