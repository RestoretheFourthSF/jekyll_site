<p>Public companies are required <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/sites/default/files/CCL/34ActRls/rule14a-8.html" target="_blank">by law</a> to permit shareholders (above a threshold amount) to add items to the annual meeting's agenda. This is largely a joke now, because shares are spread so widely that too small a number could ever attend a meeting to enact the proposal. However: due to the laws governing public companies they have to publish, read aloud, and make a show of voting on the proposal anyway. <!--more--></p>

<li>We're trying to find shareholders who own $2000 in stock of the tech companies involved in the NSA"s PRISM program. Bear in mind, this probably only works for those that are traded publicly (Twitter, we're coming for you!)</li>
<li>Once you have a shareholder, you will want to look up the schedule for annual meetings on <a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml" target="_blank">Edgar</a>, the SEC's search engine for documents. The stock ticker is the easiest tool to look that up. Example shareholder proposals will be listed in the proxy statements filed for each annual meeting, as well. Here is <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312512515422/d450591dpre14a.htm" target="_blank">Apple Inc.'s 2013 proxy statement</a>.</li>
<li>Once you have the date that the last annual meeting was announced, add a year and count back 120 days to approximate the deadline for filing a shareholder proposal. The rules for where to send the proposal should be listed in the proxy statement as well.</li>
<li>Draft a letter from the shareholder and attach the proposal (500 words maximum). The shareholder or his designee must attend the annual meeting himself in order to get a vote on the proposal. So the letter may have to designate someone to attend the annual meeting in lieu of the shareholder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please let us know by editing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApWG2DmCnC7EdFBldC1IaF9oUV9zVUNnRmJlbUk0elE#gid=0" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a> if you take these steps, so that we do not have more than one person putting forth a proposal for that annual meeting. And see <a href="http://restorethefourthsf.com/new-shareholder-activism-project-first-target-named-apple-inc/" target="_blank">this post</a> for an example of what a shareholder proposal might look like, drafted by David and Alice.</p>
