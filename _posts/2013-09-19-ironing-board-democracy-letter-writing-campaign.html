<p>If you want to get involved with the political side of the blanket surveillance issue, here's an opportunity for you!  I (Kenji) am looking for volunteers to join me in staffing an ironing board at an intersection with lots of foot traffic in Vallejo, Benicia, or Santa Rosa. The first location will probably be the <a href="http://www.pcfma.com/market_home.php?market_id=19" target="_blank">Vallejo Farmers' Market</a> (9am-1pm Saturdays).<!--more--></p>
<p>The goal of this ironing board station:  to invite passers-by to write actual pen-and-paper letters to Representative Mike Thompson, asking him to stand up for the Fourth Amendment in the future instead of defending the NSA's surveillance programs as he has done so far.</p>
<p>I'll bring the materials:  the ironing board, envelopes, paper, pens, stamps, mailing addresses of Rep. Thompson and other Bay Area members of Congress, at least one sample letter text for people to copy or adapt, and a stack of flyers explaining the blanket surveillance issue and who we are.</p>
<p>Please bring yourself, a readiness to be friendly and outgoing to our fellow citizens in the 5th Congressional District, and maybe some catchy lines to attract people to our station.  If you have a smartphone, that would be helpful for looking up addresses of any other officials whom people want to write letters to.  (My phone is of the dumb variety.)</p>
<p>I can provide a ride from and to anywhere in the East Bay, including Contra Costa County.  If interested, please leave a comment at the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourthSF/comments/1krrax/ironing_board_democracy_plan/" target="_blank">reddit page for this project.  More details are available there. </a>Let me know how to contact you and when you're available.  I welcome suggestions.</p>
