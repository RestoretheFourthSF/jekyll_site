<p>Restore the Fourth DC has collaborated with Mozilla's Stopwatching.us project to plan a rally in Washington DC on October 26th. That date is the anniversary of the PATRIOT act. If you can attend, please <a title="Rally RSVP" href="http://stopwatchingusrally.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">RSVP</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Restore the Fourth SF does not have someone coordinating efforts to help Restore the Fourth DC. If you plan to attend and would like to help others in the Bay Area to attend, please comment on this post, and we can help you get in touch with them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, sign the petition! <a href="https://optin.stopwatching.us/" target="_blank">https://optin.stopwatching.us/</a></p>
