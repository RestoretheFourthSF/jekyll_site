<p>TL;DR: There was nothing for the judge to rule on, and the next hearing is April 25th 2014 at 9 am (this is a hearing that hasn't been set for Jewel yet).</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The government attempted to delay the hearing twice, once on account of the government shutdown, and again because they wanted motions to be considered. The judge denied both requests and today a schedule for briefing and for the next hearing was set.</p>
<p>Previously, there had been some discussion of combining this case with Jewel for more efficient litigation. However, apparently both the government and the plaintiffs agreed this didn't make sense. A lawyer for of the plaintiffs laid out several differences between the cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>This case is only about mass collection of phone records (note, the government refers to this as "telephony metadata" instead - tactical word choice?). Jewel includes internet surveillance.</li>
<li>Phone record collection is being challenged while it's in progress. The Jewel case relates to several prior collection policies that may not be continuing, therefore they require inspection of the NSAs legal authority at different points in the past 12 years.</li>
<li>The first amendment freedom of association issue is a crucial difference. Here, all plaintiffs are groups. In Jewel, the plaintiffs are all individuals.</li>
<li>The federal government has admitted to colllecting phone records, so there is no issue of state secrets. This will help the case move faster than Jewel.</li>
</ul>
