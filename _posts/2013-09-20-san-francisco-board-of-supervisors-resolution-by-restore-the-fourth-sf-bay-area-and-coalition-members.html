<p>This is the draft being submitted to the BORDC, the EFF, and potential primary sponsors. Title: <strong>Resolution for the Conclusion and Investigation of Mass Surveillance</strong></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>[Protecting the constitutional rights of residents and calling for a congressional investigation into mass surveillance activities.]</p>
<p>Resolution supporting the right to privacy, reminding agencies of the City and County of San Francisco that they are not permitted to conduct or assist in mass surveillance of private communications, urging law enforcement to respect the right to privacy, and requesting our United States Senators and members of Congress to both investigate past violations and prevent future violations of the Fourth and First Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Privacy is a fundamental right reflected in the Constitution of the State of California Article 1 Section 1 and is further protected by the Fourth Amendment and other state and federal law; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, The right to privacy confers dignity and security to residents of the City and County of San Francisco, as well as protects the presumption of innocence underlying due process and their fundamental right to free speech, free association, and a free press; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, The Board of Supervisors passed Resolution 53-03 in 2003 instructing officials not to comply with the PATRIOT Act insofar as it allows violations of the rights of United States citizens; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, In 2006, Mark Klein exposed the National Security Agency’s mass interception of telecommunications at the AT&amp;T building on 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, FISA Court decisions have revealed that federal agencies have in fact unconstitutionally violated the privacy of United States citizens by harvesting domestic communications, and the NSA has admitted to allowing analysts to use databases for personal use, and storing of all communication metadata, indicating a policy and culture of disregard of privacy rights within federal agencies; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Federal agencies have incentivized cities to use surveillance against their residents, including in the City of Oakland which accepted federal funds for the Domain Awareness Center, and the City and County of San Francisco should not accept additional federal funds for unconstitutional surveillance projects; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, The City and County of San Francisco is a city of refuge for many individuals that suffer persecution, including by reason of religion, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, sexuality and gender identity, economic status, mental illness, and homelessness; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Systemic violations of privacy have a chilling effect on free speech and freedom of association which protects and advances humanity, and systematic violations of privacy erode the presumption of innocence required by due process, now therefore, be it</p>
<p>RESOLVED, That the residents of San Francisco strongly affirm our commitment to the rights and liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the State of California, and the United States Constitution, including the Fourth and First Amendments; and</p>
<p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we ask federal and state law enforcement working within the City and County of San Francisco to work in accordance with local law including the right to privacy, free speech and freedom of association provided by the Constitution of the State of California and the United States Constitution; and</p>
<p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED That the residents of San Francisco ask our United States Senators and members of Congress to launch a full independent congressional investigation into the intelligence community’s unconstitutional mass surveillance and hold individuals and agencies accountable for violations of the Fourth and First Amendments, and to restore fundamental rights and liberties embodied in the Constitution of the State of California and the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>The Board of Supervisors shall immediately send copies of this resolution to our United States Senators and members of Congress, the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the United States Attorney General, and the President of the United States.</p></blockquote>
