<p>Today, John McAfee announced a forthcoming hardware product called <a title="D-Central" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4786008/john-mcafee-d-central-device-avoid-nsa-private-network">D-Central </a>to provide consumers with private networking services that would be resistant to NSA scrutiny. He has described his product in only the highest level terms but we can infer a lot from his description and the fundamental architecture of the Internet.<!--more--></p>
<p><img class="img-frame alignright" alt="" src="assets/PirateBox_2-0_Case4.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>The D-Central seems to incorporate ideas similar to that of the <a title="MeshBox" href="https://fund.meshwith.me/">MeshBox</a> or the <a title="PirateBox" href="http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox_DIY">PirateBox</a>.  What all these initiatives have in common is they create a public environment where users can communicate privately without disclosing either content <em>or metadata</em> to the Internet providers. Most other encryption methods only prevent disclosure of  content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that D-Central, Meshbox and others can offer an accessible consumer product that can provide a mass surveillance resistant Internet experience to the masses. This is clearly possible: VPN providers, botnets, et cetera all operate darknets that have been highly resistant to compromise and surveillance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this kind of privacy-friendly Internet to truly succeed, it needs to provide both a developer platform and a business model. The centralized NSA friendly Internet developed because of the seductive appeal of easy applications development in data centers and the success of the advertising model. Without a developer platform, these experiments in Darknets are only going to be able to deliver a Web 1.0 experience of messaging and file sharing rather than compelling applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are potentially compelling aspects to an NSA-proof internet for developers. They would have to raise less capital for bandwidth and servers because costs would be distributed among their users. That's a business model, but is it enough to drive development?</p>
