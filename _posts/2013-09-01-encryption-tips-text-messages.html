<p>Bob asked me to share his writeup of the cell phone class:</p>
<p>I sat in on the android phone security break out group. To keep it simple, I'll just say a little bit about the apps for secure text and voice. They are both pretty easy to install and use.<!--more--></p>
<p>For text messages go to the App Store and download Text Secure, setup is easy, follow the prompts. Once you have exchanged a key with someone also using it, every text you send them will be encrypted. Easiest way to verify each other is in person of course, it basically sends each person a hash tag, you can do this remotely but always easier and better to do when you are together. Using this app basically overrides your standard text client, any text you send will look for the recipient also using it. If they aren't , no biggie. It then is just a standard text. Once set up, it is completely transparent to the user.</p>
<p>Encrypted voice calls:</p>
<p>Download the Red Phone app, simple to set up, again follow the prompts This works a little differently in use, it generates a one time key between the parties based on a 2 word pass phrase. Basically if you call someone also using red phone, you will each see a pass phrase, just say the phrase at the beginning of the call and then you are encrypted Again, pretty easy to use... Oh, one of the devs was there and I asked him about VoIP and yes, this works on that too. So if you use google voice or Skype, your voice calls will still be encrypted .</p>
<p>Both of these apps are from whisper net and free to use.</p>
<p>Oh, we did talk a bit about encrypting all of your phones data as well. Go to settings/security/encrypt device, follow the prompts. Encrypting all of your phones data will take some time, be sure you are plugged in to your charger</p>
<p>Also discussed password security for your phone, it's kind of a balance there... Sure, a 40 character password is more secure but who wants to type that in every time you want to unlock your phone You should have one but its up to you how hard you want to make it for yourself</p>
