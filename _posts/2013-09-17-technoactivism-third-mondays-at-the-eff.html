<p>Here is a summary of some of the discussion at the EFF! Quotes are unattributed, sorry. <a href="https://wiki.openitp.org/doku.php?id=events%3Atechno-activism_3rd_mondays">https://wiki.openitp.org/doku.php?id=events%3Atechno-activism_3rd_mondays</a></p>
<p><strong>Threat Levels</strong></p>
<p>We should distinguish between different threat levels because they require different levels of encryption security. We also have to be aware that the threat level only increases if your content is "worthwhile enough" so a way to avoid needing further encryption protection would be to avoid being noticed as worthwhile. The key to that is to hide metadata.</p>
<p>The threat level concept eventually breaks down, however, because in order to communicate outside the secure group, you are immediately downgraded to "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">lowest common denominator</span>" encryption techniques.<!--more--></p>
<p>One goal could be to resist the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chilling effect</span> of NSA surveillance. Encryption should be universally used, and always end to end, to prevent First Amendment issues.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, the NSA always prefers passive attacks over active ones. Passive attaches are cheaper, less noticeable. End to end encryption is the way to protect from passive attacks. It might not protect against active attacks (targetting). SO we can FORCE the NSA to do active attacks, explicitly targeting a defined threat, by using encryption - trap them into fishing with a rod instead of a net.</p>
<p>HTTPS is a part of end to end encryption and relying on it would kill some NSA data collection programs alone.</p>
<p>Back to threat models, though - everyone is working with a different one. If by some unfortunate circumstance you are being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACTIVELY targeted</span> by the NSA, you just have to throw away all of your computers. And some people have done that. For us, that's not necessary.</p>
<p>If your threat model is "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ability to publis</span>h" and issues of censorship, let's say in a country like Iran or Syria, it's easier to protect you. The EFF software designers have a customer base of publishers in oppressive regimes. But we have to understand what the threats are, what techniques of surveillance and attack are being used, before we know what software we need to build. The EFF is 2-3 months away from producing this solution.</p>
<p>Generally reduce your footprint to protect yourself as well, less data needs to be encrypted if less of it is available. Don't necessarily throw away all your computers, but find a way to limit how much personal data is transmitted through them.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Government Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>How are foreign governments acquiring surveillance technologies? They're basically buying them off the shelf. They have no internal talent, it's basically an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arms trade</span>. Currently it's so crude that the target can actually see what they are doing. They're buying DDOS botnets for example, to target individual journalists, or hiring freelance hackers to create malware.</p>
<p>The surveillance systems that are for sale will become more and more sophisticated and harder to detect. And internationally there is almost no structural protection against this tool. We're actually a LOT safer in the US because we even have these privacy laws in the first place.</p>
<p>These <span style="text-decoration: underline;">off-the-shelf surveillance products</span> are a justification for the NSA activity. The US government's optimal position is to make sure no foreign governments can surveil their citizenry, but that they have full access. Therefore, their technology must be infinitely superior to whats available elswhere. They need an assymetry betwen what the US can do and what our enemies can do. That's the justification. Only the US government can invade the privacy of US citizens, esentially.</p>
<p>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data at rest</span>" questions - once the data is stored on a server that's a security issue too. Passive data collection requires data on the move. But data at rest is much more protected in the US than elsewhere. That's why PRISM ignited fear globally.</p>
<p>How do the laws work in other countries? Caroline uses <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GCHQ</span> in Britain as an example. They claim the right to access any data that travels through underseas cables under "RIPA" law. It's irrelevant who sent or received it, even if it's an entirely domestic communication it might still bounce to these underseas cables.  That's less protection than in the US, at least FISA appears to require one end be outside the US, and even US citizens outside the US have some protections.</p>
<p><strong>Using v. Collecting</strong></p>
<p>One question is, how are they using this data? Isn't that what we're really worried about? Even the collection of the data is unconstitutional, none of the constraints that the fourth amendment is interpreted to provide apply to collection at all. Restore the Fourth's resolution, for example, is solely about collection - it's also very hard to prove that the data is being used. Efficiency suggests that the use is in fact limited to targets in some way. But there are no good examples yet - it would expose NSA's capabilities if they admitted where they got the  evidence. So for example the DEA will construct <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a second chain of evidence</span> afterwards.</p>
<p>Use in a civil subpoena context? The ECPA prevents private companies from giving out more than just the basic IP address type information. Also, they might not provide the data because it's a hassle.</p>
<p><strong>An Aside</strong>: Look into the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy" target="_blank"> forward security protection </a>technique. This involves using different keys for every communication and then destroying them after the communication has been read. Like a digital "'burn after reading."</p>
