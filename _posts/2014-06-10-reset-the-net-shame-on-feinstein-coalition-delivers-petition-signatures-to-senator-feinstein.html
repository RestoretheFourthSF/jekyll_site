<p>On June 5th 2014, the Shame on Feinstein coalition delivered 2,000 signatures gathered from Californians to the Senator's staff. California is home to the Silicon Valley and to many of technological visionaries that built the Internet. Senator Feinstein has advocated for nothing less than the transformation of Internet into a tools for pervasive surveillance of Americans.</p>
<p>The Shame On Feinstein coalitions told the Senator's staff than nothing less than a ban on un-targeted, dragnet surveillance was acceptable to her constituents.</p>
<p>Senator Feinstein's term ends in 2018 and she is unlikely to run again. The Shame on Feinstein coalition will do anything in our power to ensure that the fake reforms bills she supports from FISA Improvements Act to the House version of USA Freedom Act do not become law.</p>
